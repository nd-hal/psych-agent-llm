About five years ago, my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. As her primary caregiver, I took on a lot of responsibility for managing her daily routine, medications, and doctor's appointments. Through that experience, I learned a great deal about the progression of the disease, its effects on cognitive function, and the importance of creating a supportive environment for her. I also had to navigate the healthcare system","Often I don't know much about what is going on with me medically, once I get the results of blood tests or other diagnostic information is when I start studying and trying to understand. I once got pregnant while using an IUD and being on the pill. I had an intrauterine and an ectopic pregnancy at the same time. They always teach reproduction at the end of anatomy and physiology courses (6/6 times for me it was at the end) so it's usually rushed and cursory, so I needed the doctors to explain a ton to me. Like I didn't know that ectopic fetus' (feti?) don't grow at the same rate as intrauterine ones.

It was. Then he googled a few conditions in front of me and suggested I might have diabetes.
