I once got pregnant while using an IUD and being on the pill. I had an intrauterine and an ectopic pregnancy at the same time. They always teach reproduction at the end of anatomy and physiology courses (6/6 times for me it was at the end) so it's usually rushed and cursory, so I needed the doctors to explain a ton to me. Like I didn't know that ectopic fetus' (feti?) don't grow at the same rate as intrauterine ones. Anyway, all the things I learned through that experience, like that I have a bicornuate uterus that makes my IUD less effective, were things I had to explain clearly to new health care providers as I have moved around."}]}

Conventional transport measurements can be performed with lock-in amplifiers or resistance bridges using the extreme environments available at the NHMFL. In addition, very sensitive skin depth measurements can also be used where a sample is placed in the inductor coil of a resonant tunnel diode oscillator circuit. Frequency changes to the circuit allow one to learn about the penetration depth of superconductors, susceptibility of magnetic materials or perform quantum oscillation studies on metals. This technique has the advantage of being contactless to avoid damaging fragile samples m. "}]}
