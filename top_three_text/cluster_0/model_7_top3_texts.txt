The more I listened to him, I figured that the first half of his diagnosis was the end result of what I was saying in the second half. Through my daughter's ten-year dance career I became accustomed to hearing what types of injuries/damage dancers can develop that could limit their careers. As the doctor explained my daughter's condition, he kept mentioning things I had heard from differnt ballet teachers over the years. Because of that, I could align what the doctor was saying with the risks associated with intense dancing."]

This doesn't have to be life-threatening, it could be as simple as finding out that a treatment must go on loner than anticipated.  Second to that is anxiety about not remembering to ask the right things or explain myself and my symptoms or condition fully, and then being misdiagnosed or wasting my time and money.My grandfather went to the urologist and had a PSA blood test done.  I knew from his results, being over 3.0, that this meant he would likely need a biopsy to test for prostate cancer.  I also knew that these tests could produce higher than normal levels if the patient has an enlarged prostate.  I asked to see his former results.  They were up and down a lot, which is typically a sign that there is NOT prostate cancer, but instead, an enlarged prostate.  I also knew that an enlarged prostate could be due to prostatitis, an infection of the prostate.  Sure enough, he went back to the doctor to follow up, and turned out to have a prostate infection.
