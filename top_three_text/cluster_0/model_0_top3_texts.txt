- I feel that I am very capable of processing the information and making informed decisions.  However, I find that I often forget to ask pertinent questions that I later think of at home.  I may also do some more research at home and find that I have more questions.  There have also been times where my doctor was unable to provide me with a satisfactory answer to my questions.I've worked in healthcare (previously) for over 15 years, and have had first-hand experience with many doctors.  I've seen a side of doctors that patients don't see, and some of these interactions have fostered a lack of trust.  I've had experiences where I've gone to see a new doctor and they've had a prescription written for me before I even spoke to them.  I've seen my husband prescribed contraindicated medications that caused an adverse reaction that even I knew shouldn't be taken together.  But, alternatively, I've had some doctors who treated me well who I've really trusted.  I've known other doctors to go out of their way to cater to their patient's needs/fears/wishes.My biggest fear is that I will receive news contrary to what I'm hoping for.  This doesn't have to be life-threatening, it could be as simple as finding out that a treatment must go on loner than anticipated.  Second to that is anxiety about not remembering to ask the right things or explain myself and my symptoms or condition fully, and then being misdiagnosed or wasting my time and money.My grandfather went to the urologist and had a PSA blood test done.  I knew from his results, being over 3.0, that this meant he would likely need a biopsy to test for prostate cancer.  I also knew that these tests could produce higher than normal levels if the patient has an enlarged prostate.  I asked to see his former results.  They were up and down a lot, which is typically a sign that there is NOT prostate cancer, but instead, an enlarged prostate.  I also knew that an enlarged prostate could be due to prostatitis, an infection of the prostate.  Sure enough, he went back to the doctor to follow up, and turned out to have a prostate infection.
