Within a month of exiting the hospital, I suffered a DVT and had a bout of ventricular tachycardia.  After 12 years of ongoing monitoring and medication, I have gained a significant knowledge of the state of my own health.  I have also had other surgeries, and currently suffer from an arthritic damaged knee that needs replacement.  At sixty five years old&lt; I guess it is just the cumulative knowledge that a person gains through these experiences which has added to my health knowledge."}]}
