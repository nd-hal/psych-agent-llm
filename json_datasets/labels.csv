I can make health decisions on my own, for the most part.",I have a general anxiety towards all doctors and healthcare providers.

This is something that I just have to deal with when seeing a doctor.,I was once over weight.

My orthopedic surgeon knows exactly what I can do and is proud of my accomplishments.
"I am an intelligent person who unfortunately has had to deal with health issues, info and services for many years. This required me to become a very pro active patient. I keep abreast of everything to do with my health issues and am up to date on everything including medication and treatment options and services available to me.  And when I have a question or concern I consult with my physician or my husband who was in the health care field for 30 years.","Getting weighed every single time makes me anxious. My white coat blood pressure makes me anxious... I tell the person who takes my blood pressure before the doctor comes in to wait a few minutes and ask me the standard questions and refer to my online chart BEFORE taking my blood pressure.

Neurologists all over the country give their newly diagnosed patients my phone number and email because they find that I'm better at explaining things than they are sometimes because I've lived with MS for 40 years. This doesn't say that I can do percentages anymore, but I have been a great  layperson neurological and psychological source to countless people I've been told for more years than I can count:-)","I don't totally trust my primary care physician mostly because I don't know him well enough. He took over when my long time primary care physician retired. What I do know of him is that he is nice enough but always in a hurry and I swear he just looks at his computer and checks off what blood tests I need. If he touches me physically at all it is to listen with his stethoscope and to feel my neck. That's it. Not that I want him to examine every part of me every time, but maybe a bit more thoroughness and a human touch? It's a good thing I'm proactive because if I didn't mention and point out specific problems that should be obvious to a trained physician, I don't think he'd notice."
I feel that I have a high capacity to make appropriate health decisions based on the information I receive.  I always make sure to ask any questions I have no matter how small they seem.  I make sure I understand what I need to before I leave the office as I want to make sure I get better and don't do anything to make my condition worse.  I try not to use things like webMD or other things on the computer and just listen to my doctor.  I don't want to get any false information or confuse myself.  I trust my primary health physician as he has been right in the past and has helped me get over a few things with no complications and fairly quickly in all instances as well.  He goes over any documents or directions with me before I leave so I can ask questions and so he knows I understand everything.  ,Mostly just that the doctor is going to find something really bad.  I am not worried about what the doctor will do or the physical examition itself.  Just the part in the back of your mind that he may diagnose something very bad.  That is what makes me worried and a little uneasy.  Not a whole lot just in the back of my mind.,"About two years ago I awoke one morning with a large bump on my back.  It was very painful and pus was oozing out of it.  I went to the minute clinic because that was fast to get into.  The lady just said it was probably a bug bite and nothing serious.  I hadn't ever had a reaction like this to a bug before and knew that where the bump was, on my back near my spine, that I needed to get another opinion.  I got into my normal physician about five hours later.  he said it was good that I came in because it was severely infected and the infection area was getting very close to my spine and getting into my blood stream.  If I hadn't known something was worse than was diagnosed at the minute clinic I could have easily ended up in the hospital.",I have gone to him a few times in the past couple years.  He has always been diligent and has diagnosed my conditions correctly each time.  He had to do a couple small procedures which went great.  I have gotten better each time and have had no complications when recovering.  He has done a fantastic job.  Takes the time to make sure he knows what is wrong and goes over everything I need to know and answers my questions.

When my doctor ask questions i fully understand with I'm asked. ,"when they stop the convo and you start to think something is wrong with you, or you scared of your weight or blood pressure.",the last time I went t the doctor the doctor told me had  a higher changes of get high blood pressure or high cholesterol.,i just trust my doctor ho when to school and I know she care about her patients.

I feel that the doctor will try and diagnose me with something that I do not have. ,I told the doctor that I had a blood clot and he kept saying that I didnot until I went back for a CT scan that revealed a blood clot.,"I do not trust completely in my doctor or any doctor for that matter. In 2010, I kept having chest pains and the doctor said that it was nothing. I had them for about a week and then one day I almost passed out in the parking of my electric company and I was taken to the ER. Come to find out I had a blood clot in my lung. I do not trust doctors. If I have a illness I will try and fix it myself."
I often re-read the medical forms to be sure I am answering them to the best of my ability but I find myself holding back questions for doctors because I don't feel comfortable in my own abilities in sounding educated. I am in constant pain from fibromyalgia and have had difficulty in finding a doctor that won't just give me some pills for depression and send me on my way. ,I worry that I will be referred to yet another doctor who will then refer me to another doctor. I am also worried that I will be told that the only thing they can do is give me another pill to take. ,"My sister was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, stage 3C. I was able to tell her about the different options for treatment. ",My primary care physician is kind and he listens but I feel he is often in a hurry and hears my words but only the ones that he wants to. He wants to order more test on top of more tests and sends me to other doctors that I can not afford even after I express to him that I do not have the finances to go to others. 
i believe that i can comprehend most of the medical documents i only have a problem when they require signatures and also when they use medical terminology to describe things that could be put simply. ,"that i will be belittled, and my concerns wont be addressed because they will make up their mind about it with little information and dont do a full exam.","this has never happened to me, i always research my symptoms and then go to the doctor to see if the internet was right or wrong. then ask the dr why its this and not these other things.;","i haven't been to my primary in years because when i had a medical problem and i came to them they said they wouldn't do test because it wasn't their ""area"". they are general practitioners. everything is their area they could have taken blood and run labs and then refereed me but they didn't do anything  "
when in visit a doctor I try to get as much information that is needed for my health like what is required of me the type of sickness I can get and what is happening to me I tend to also ask a lot of questions just to get a better  understanding on what is going on in bed ,to find out what is wrong with me and sometimes I don't want to hear the truth because it will have me overthinking about it,I have asthma which it often have me to be rush to the doctor for check up and such and taking medication which I sometimes don't like to take but because of my health I have to take it ,sometimes I think they take things out of control because everyone body is different and sometimes the things they said we should be taking it ends up making us worst or bad 
I understand them most of the time. I have a bad rememberer but a good forgetter. I do try to have the dr to explain my conditions. sometimes I wonder if they know their selves,worried about what she might find. have had a lot of health issues lately and never know what to expect.,I understand very little . I try to understand what all of my dr's try to tell me.. I never thought I would have the health problems I have had at the age I am.l,my main dr is a va dr. I trust her for the present time. sometimes I feel that she is just searching for a problem and a cure. but overall I am pleased with what she has done.
"Most times when I am given medical information related to my conditions or the prescriptions that I may have to take I usually have a good understanding of what I am told. However, when I do have questions I still like to ask general questions in case there was something that was omitted or missed accidentally. Usually when I have an ER visit I definitely ask questions because it seems as if the doctors only care about getting you out as fast possible unless your in need of life support.","I went to the emergency room several months ago because my feet were swollen for a few weeks and it was painful for me to walk or stand. In addition to the pain and swelling there was a very aggressive rash on both feet. After sitting in the ER for hours, the doctor told me I had athlete's foot. I followed his instructions and took the medications and one weeks later the condition only got worse. I went to my physician and was then told the problem was an extension of my eczema and that he would put in a referral for me  to see a dermatologist. After a few reminders and months later, I am still waiting to see a dermatologist.",I knew I had GERD after realizing that some over-the counter medications were no longer effective in treating my symptoms.  had also noticed that something as simple as drinking a glass of water too fast would trigger heart burn and a great deal of discomfort. ,"Sometimes I feel the doctors are only going to do as much as they need to cover the basics. For instance, if a patient only have medicaid or medicare the doctors will not suggest better treatment options that are available because the health care doesn't cover it. This practice is done without regard to the patient being able to fund the treatment in another capacity. This same treatment is the opposite for those with private healthcare. "
As a former Nurses Assistant and Med Tech i feel i have an above average understanding of medical terminology and practices.,Mostly i am anxious about my medical conditions and hoping they are not getting worse and hoping the changes i have made towards improving my health are working,As a med tech i received my diabetes speciality which enabled me to administer the stick test for diabetes and administer insulin using a sliding scale.,I like her because she presents all options and treatments and pros and cons without biasing me towards them and she is open to conventional and non conventional treatments
I have all of the abilities I need to read and process this type of information and make my medical decisions. I don't need anybody's help with that at all.,That my blood pressure will be high when I'm getting it checked there. I take a couple of prescriptions for that and it's always lower when I test it at home vs. what the number are in the doctor's office.,"When my kids are sick I know how to take care of them, like if they're running a temperature. I know when they need to be checked out by the pediatrician and when it's just a regular cold that they can't do anything about.",I've had the same doctor for the last three years. He seems pretty thorough and accomplishes everything that needs to be done during my visits. He's brought up tests I could do if I wanted to but doesn't push them on me.
I feel confident because at one time I was considering becoming a nurse. My mother was a nurse and I took a medical terminology coarse ,I had thyroid cancer in the past and I need people who will pay attention to what I am saying and treat me as a patient and not as a disease ,I had thyroid cancer and became very aware of radio active iodine and the fact your thyroid is the only organ that sucks up iodine and TSH is some thing that everyone who has a thyroid removed needs to replace and what T3 and T4 was. I started a thyroid support group so I could support others going through this scary experience ,The last time I want to my doctor he seemed rushed and had other things to do do. He said he was going to do a tetnas shot that day. He never marked it in his notes so the nurse never gave it. 
"I feel as if I have little to no trouble understanding medically relevant information given me by doctors or nurses. Sometimes I find myself unfamiliar with certain medical terminology, but I always make sure that I am confident in my understanding before I leave the office. ",I am worried that the doctor is going to tell me that I have something seriously wrong. Ever since my dad's cancer diagnosis 4 years ago (and his ensuing death in 2015) I have been close to terrified every time I have to see the doctor. ,"Well, when my dad was sick, I attended many of his doctors appointments, chemo treatments, etc. with him. I feel as if I picked up a lot during that time. When it came time for my dad to enter the hospice program, I was able to take care of him myself and home, albeit with the help of a nurse and other family members. I administered medications to help keep him relaxed and comfortable. I turned him in his bed to try to keep him from getting bedsores. When he developed shingles, I kept him as clean and comfortable as possible. I understood what medicines he was on and what they were doing to and for him. I knew enough to understand the process that was taking place inside his body. Sometimes I wish I hadn't. ","I trust my doctor implicitly. He is more internal medicine, so I have been able to see the same doctor since I was a child. My parents saw him, I even have a couple friends who were delivered by him. He has been practicing medicine in the community for decades longer than I've been alive, and he's always had excellent bedside manner. Everyone loves him. "
"I am fairly confident in my ability to understand what I am told by medical professionals. However, sometimes I am bad at thinking of appropriate questions in the moment, such as clarifying questions about what I am told. I also need to put a lot of effort into being organized before an appointment in order to make sure I say everything I need to about my symptoms. When it comes to written documents I am giving after an appointment explaining my diagnosis, I am generally confident in my ability to understand, and that anything unclear is easily researched online if not.","I am most worried about examinations which may be physically painful or uncomfortable, as this has necessarily been a common occurrence for me lately. I am also a reserved person, and therefore may feel physically or even emotionally vulnerable in these moments. This is particularly true if my condition is a source of embarrassment to me, such as a urinary tract infection. I may also be anxious about forgetting to ask a clarifying question in the moment, or otherwise missing the opportunity to inform myself or give the doctor helpful information which can lead to more effective treatment.","When I went to a doctor last year about painful anal fissures and haemorrhoids, I was already pretty well informed about them. This was due in part to having researched them in the past, both in how they relate to poor diet and how they can be caused or exacerbated by anal sex. I already knew going in that these would take a long time to heal, so I didn't expect a quick recovery. Furthermore, I was able to ask better clarifying questions during my appointment due to my prior knowledge, which helped me understand what I needed to do as well as diagnose the cause more quickly.","I generally trust the doctors that I see because I respect their knowledge and experience. This is particularly true when I see specialists about a particular condition. I have faith when seeing a specialist that they have seen many patients with my condition and that they will be able to quickly find a cure or method to manage the condition. I also try to use this opportunity to ask general questions about the condition to them, which I believe is more informative than if I searched online on my own."
To make the appropriate health decisions  and understand basic health information  I feel like I'm pretty confident I could handle it by myself.  Sometimes if I do need help I will just find somebody and have them explain it to me.   I would say 75% of the time I could figure it out.  However I never sign anything that I do not fully understand. Because me and my wife work separate shifts  I have no choice to go to the doctors myself and fill everything else as well as take my 2 children to the doctors and fill their information out.   Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%. Legal documents I may have somebody review just because they're legal documents and they have to be correct a 100%,There are a few things that could make you feel anxious when visiting a doctor's office.  A couple things that make me anxious or worried is how much the copay is going to be and if I paid my  Deductible yet or in my going to get charged a ton of money.  The next thing I worry about is sitting in the waiting room with all the sick people.   Another thing that makes me anxious on the way to The Doctor's office is how long the wait is going to be in the waiting room.  Also if your blood pressure is going to be high when you 1st get there because all the waiting.,I was on vacation one time and my wife had a urinary tract infection. Over a couple experiences I had I had learned that if you mix baking soda with ice water and drink it really fast cure hurt urinary tract infection if it's in the early stages.  Well we were on a boat in the middle of the ocean and long story short there wasn't any doctors around unless there was a really expensive one and the lower level of the ship.  After being unexpected vacation we are not about to pay so we figure we would give this trick a try.  Surprisingly it was very hard to let the chef get us some baking soda. He wanted to know what we are doing with it why we wanted it it was actually quite daunting.  Once we finally got it she continued that for a couple days and it was cleared up completely.,It is my opinion that a lot of doctors are just out for the money and they want to rush you out and get the next patient in.  I do not think all doctors are like that but I do think that when someone is looking for a blocked or to choose they should really make sure they feel comfortable that they're getting treated properly.   Also if you have something majorly wrong with you I believe that a second or even a 3rd opinion is a good idea.   I believe it's called a practice because no doctors perfect and every doctor it continuously learning.  When experience I recently had is I was sent to the emergency room with a stomach related problem the doctors was full and I got sent to the heart floor for an overnight visit.   They gave me an EKG even though I was not there for my heart in charge me anyways even though I disputed it.   I am they're young and have a very healthy heart there was no reason for that.
I feel i have a great capacity to get understanding of medical information. I always ask questions from medical professionals to be sure I have the correct information and to be sure I understand everything.,"I have been diagnosed with anxiety and lately, due to situations In my life, my condition has worsened.","When I noticed that something was wrong with my side, so I purchased an at home UTI test and realized that I had a severe UTI infection that traveled to my kidneys.",I have had experiences with my primary care physician in which they have not disclosed an issue with me and the issue became worse before I was finally able to get treatment because of this.
"I feel that I have the capacity to understand a good amount of what doctors or nurses are telling me because I work in the medical field. If I did not, I think it would be much more confusing as a patient,",I do not typically get worried when going to the Dr. Unless it is going to be a painful procedure.,I have a masters degree in occupatiol therapy and work in a hospital setting.,My doctor is calm and collected and very sympathetic. She seems to care about me as a patient so I trust her.
"I have full capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions?, I would make sure I have enough information from the doctor and follow up literature. Also, I would research online to further my understanding and to get a solid support for my decision.",Not getting the results back quickly is what makes me anxious when going to the doctor or if she can't give me an answer right away and has to rely on lab results instead.,I diagnosed my son's strep throat symptoms referring to online medical resources. I was then able to accurately explain to the doctor where the pain was and the film on his glands.,"I trust my primary physician to do her best but no one is perfect and everyone has flaws, so I don't completely trust her because she can make a mistake due to human error."
"I feel very confident with my answers, mostly because if I don't understand something I am very good at looking it up on the computer. But I mostly comprehend what they tell me. Also I am like a very smart person.","Me personally, I have social anxiety disorder. So I feel uneasy just leaving my house. I feel like mine gives the most worst case scenario much of the time. I end up worrying a lot until they get the test results back. I have been told I might have cancer. False alert. I was told I have diabetes and had to stick my finger twice a day for a year. Just to have another doctor tell me I didn't have it. etc.",I went to the doctor for a urinary tract infection. I usually try to fight it off on my own with fluids like cranberry juice. When I wait it turns into a kidney infection. This last time I didn't wait. So I was able to say with confidence to the Dr that it was just a UTI instead of a kidney infection.,I have found that a lot of them will prescribe something because they benefit from the pharmaceutical representatives. I usually do more research on medicines to find out which is best for me. Some doctors know more or just care more than others. 
"I feel competent when it comes to obtaining, processing, and understanding health information and I feel competent to make the appropriate decisions for me. I am quite well informed on a multitude of health information, and I spend time online doing my own research. General Practitioners are very useful, but I feel responsible for understanding my own health problems and researching them as much as I can. I have disagreed with a prognosis before and ended up being right. It pays to be vigilant. ","I really don't care much anymore. I am 69, have lived a full life, and I fully expect my health to deteriorate and I am capable of accepting that. The only thing that makes me close to anxious about visiting the doctor are painful shots, but I can handle it. ","I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and found that diagnosis to be a bit unbelievable. I did my own research, prior to the internet, and decided it was a bogus diagnosis based on my symptoms. I have not had any signs of rheumatoid arthritis and that diagnosis was over 20 years ago. ",The primary care physicians I have dealt with are overworked and unable to completely focus on one case at a time. That is the nature of health care today for all but the very rich. This is just the way it is. I feel responsible for knowing and researching as much as I can for my own good. 
"Yes, I feel confident that I can obtain information on health services and medical conditions. It is easily accessible on the internet and thru my health insurance provider (via phone or live chat on the provider website).",I feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor's office for something that is not routine (outside of my regular appointments). It is the unknown that I worry about.,"I had to speak to the doctor about my autoimmune condition. After doing research on the internet, I was able to self-diagnose my condition and identify causes of the condition. I had a good discussion with my doctor having this knowledge beforehand.","I trust my primary care physician because they always listed, answer my questions, and never seem to rush thru the appointment. If something is wrong, they always make a follow up phone call."
I feel I have a capacity greater than most others in my age group to understand health information. I come from a family of health professiols and have a good vocabulary when it comes to healthcare terms. I also worked as a CSR for a major heath insurance company for a couple years.,Most of my anxiety comes from the doctor feeling that I need further testing beyond what is covered by my insurance. ,"I have two elderly parents who live part time in Florida, where I live, and I am usually called upon to help them if there are any serious health issues that come up as the rest of my family lives up north. I have more than once had to spend time in the hospital as the only receiver of their health info for the family.",I have had the same PCP for about 5 years and she has never made me feel rushed and always asks thorough questions about the status of my health. When I have had any problems she made sure to order the appropriate testing.
I have a good understanding of my healthcare and decisions. I mainly attribute this to the fact that I work in the medical field.,The thing that makes me feel most anxious is fear of the unknown. Sometimes I worry something might be seriously wrong with me.,I work as a medical coder and biller. I know a lot about health insurance. I have been able to educate several of my clinicÃ¢ÂÂs Medicare patients.,"I do not have a primary care physician. In general, I always like to question my doctor though. ItÃ¢ÂÂs part of my nature."
"I have good reading comprehension and a graduate degree. While I am not a health professional, I could figure out what was being told to me or presented in written form.","I do not feel anxious or worried when visiting the doctor unless I fear that I have a serious problem, which means that I would be more worried about whatever the problem was (or could be). If I have any idea what I'm there for there is no worry.","I'm not sure of what you are asking for in this question. I do not demonstrate knowledge of medical issues, though I'm smart enough to get a general understanding of what is being explained to me.","I would generally assume that they are giving honest answers, and given their training and experience it would seem sensible to trust them. They would have little reason to deceive me, although some of it involves guessing."
"In that regards, I have no problem ether in filling out forms, reading and understanding the information contained there-in, but neither do  I  have any problems in asking the doctor questions on subjects that I may have a question on, or in providing the information he would need to treat me for the reason I am seeing him.","The only thing that could cause us to be anxious or worried would be for him to not be able to decide what the problem was at the time we see him, over the years, our doctor has not had that problem in any of our appointments with him.",Guess it would have to be my last brush with a medical problem. Had right lung that decided to not work anymore & deflated. Spent 8 days in hospital and went through extensive tests & other treatments before every thing was corrected. Did learn a lot about the lung functions & how to try & ensure it doesn't happen again.,"We have been seeing the same doctor for past 17 years, & have complete confidence in his treatment of all of our problems that may crop up. Our doctor has our complete faith that he will correctly tell us what is wrong, and order the proper test/medicine we will need to correct it. "
"I feel truly confident in my capacity to make appropriate health decisions. I can understand what the doctor says, and if I do not understand I am able to ask questions and clear my doubts. ","I am anxious about my condition, whether it is improved or worsened. Because I am really trying to take care of myself with respect to this condition, I am really worried if it is not working in the good direction.",I was able to understand what my doctor was saying. I was familiar with  the drugs given which was found helpful at the pharmacy as well.,My doctor takes a lot of time and effort to explain my conditions to me. He gives guidance for modifying my diet in connection with my medication. He also gives directions to appropriate resource persons. He also provides scientific literature regarding my condition.
I feel that I am 80% good for doing that. I will be able to do it so what I will make sure of it. I can do it better than any one else. I will be a good person to do it so you should pick me to do this.,What's would make me feel that way would be the nit knowing what news I will be getting . Faking and knowing something bad is about to be sad is scary and I wouldn't be sure if I would be ready to hear anything like that .,The problems will be bad if I didn't have what unneeded to have .

So if you could help me with that, that would be amazing . Thank you vert much ."
I believe my ability to understand health information is sound. I have a medical condition that requires frequent contact with medical personnel to manage it. I have been able to do this for the past 3 years. ,I am most concerned about what may be found about my medical condition.  There may be something new that appears about my condition.,"I smoked cigarettes for a number of years, but quit when my children were young and information about health riskd associated with smoking became available.",I taught in medical schools and know about their selection and training.  It is a time-tested process.  The quality of practicing physicians is assured by this process.
"I don't feel like I have any trouble understanding and processing the information I receive.  Even if I don't understand something right away, I know where to go to get help figuring it all out.","The only thing that typically makes me nervous is the doctor finding something that concerns him that I had not recognized in myself.  The fear of being diagnosed with a serious illness, even though i'm not having any symptoms, is really what makes me anxious.","When my father was going through the process of being diagnosed with alzheimer's disease, I had to attend every doctor's appointment with him and my mother because they couldn't understand a lot the information they were getting.  The doctor felt most confident talking directly to me and having me try to relay the information to my parents in terms they understand.  My parents also relied on me to help them make the decisions regarding my father's care.","I trust my doctor because he has always been able to treat and cure any ailment that I present to him.  I always wonder if he (or any doctor) is sometimes motivated to recommend treatments that are fincially beneficial to him, however.  I don't believe my doctor has done that with me, but it is always in the back of my mind."
"Assuming that a doctor or other provider is not withholding information, I believe I have the full ability to understand and process information related to my health.  I believe I have an adequate understanding of medical terminology to comprehend what a doctor is telling me and make an appropriate decision.","What causes me anxiety at a doctor's office?  A request for a blood sample, or the need to have an IV.  I really do not care for needles or for blood draws.  Not sure exactly why, but both are something that I would prefer to avoid.","My then 9-year old son was using the bathroom a lot.  He was running to urinate about every 15 minutes or so.  After observing this for a few days, I asked him if he was also thirsty.  He said he was.  I told my wife that he likely had diabetes and that we needed to get him to the doctor first thing tomorrow (it was a Sunday when I was talking with him).  The doctor checked his blood sugar the next day and found that it was over 700.  We got his diabetes under control and so far, he has continued to live a good life (he is now almost 22).","I guess I could say that I trust my primary doctor because he hasn't given me a reason not to trust him.  He is upfront, tells me about options, explains procedures, and is good natured.  I believe he is looking out for my best interests and until he does otherwise, I will have trust in him."
I feel pretty confident that I have the ability to understand basic health information that's given to me and to make decisions for myself. I don't always feel confident that doctors are giving me the right information though or that they have taken the time to understand my issues.,I'm usually most worried that I will receive some bad news. I've had a lot of health problems in the past and always feel like the worst possible scenario is going to come true.,"I had a herniated disc several years ago. Even though I was recommended to have a discectomy, I went to rehab for three months. During the course of rehab and through research on my own, I acquired the knowledge to manage my back pain without surgery and continued my own rehab program independently until I got back to having pretty normal function.","My PCP is thorough and detail-oriented, but I also feel like he dismisses what he sees as minor issues too easily. He's also quick to send me elsewhere to a specialist if anything even remotely complex comes up."
You  must ask every question that is needed to get the information you need to make sure that the doctor is treating you for the right thing and giving you the right treatment ,Coming back with results hoping they didn't pick up someone information .I don't want to be treated for something I don't have by someone making a mistake ,I just had fibroids remove and I had the best doctor in the west coast.I had no after problems surgery went get no pain after,He is very true and I never had a misunderstanding and understand my needs and wants.Always diagnosis me right
I am confident I understand basic health information. I worked at a Primary Care Physician's office.,"Waiting, for test results makes me worried if everything is normal. Also, the waiting for the DR. before your exam and not knowing what will be done.",I worked at a Primary Care Physician's office so I am somewhat familiar with some health and medical issues.,I trust my Dr. But sometimes they need to take people serious and learn about a disease instead of blowing it off.
I feel I have a good doctor and am able to openly communicate and discuss issues with them. I am open about my health issues which I think you need to be in order to get the help you need. I understand for the most part what the Dr says and what I am not sure of I ask questions. My husband will also ask questions which further helps with any questions that may arise or answers we may need. My husband and I share the same Doctor and we typically schedule appointments at the same time so the Doctor sees us together in an hour block.  This also helps us communicate better as we are both there and can both ask questions we may have,Nothing really nowÃ¢ÂÂ because we have had the same Doctor for several years and we know him and converse openly with him. He is friendly and remembers persol details about us which help a lot. He is always open and honest and has always taken very good care of us when we have had needs. We both go to the Doctor regularly and because of that and our relationship with the Doctor there is a large level of comfort now,My mother is 93 years old and has dementia and my husband and myself are her caregivers. We monitor and take care of her health including her type II diabetes and blood pressure. She has had various health issues including hospitalization due to falls and from all this experience we have learned much on how to cope with and mage her health and safety as well as being aware of complications and things to monitor,My husband and I share the same Doctor and there was a time my husband had an appointment and I did not and I went with him. I had a cold at the time and even though it was not my appointment and I didn't bring it upÃ¢ÂÂ the Doctor noticed and asked me questions. Right then and there he wrote a prescription for me even though I didn't have an appointment for myself. He has always gone above and beyond in the care of my husband as well (who has Type II diabetes) and has always been there for us when we had questions and needs. I would recommend him to anyone.
I always write down any problems between visits with primary or specialist so I can bring it up on next visit or if I think I need immediate care go in to see Dr. right away.,That I forget to bring up something that I have written down and that I will have to come back. That what Dr. tells me is something that I need to worry about.,I have learned how to take my blood pressure using a stethoscope and a spigramonter and also how to check my pulse manually.,"My Doctor explains everything to me, sometimes I do not grasps everything but if it is put in his notes I can look it up. If I need to see him he will see me but I will have to wait to be squeezed between appointments of other people. "
I have had many health issues due to a car accident and I'm well versed in these situations.  I feel I can confidently understand the written instructions provided in a medical situation.,"That the problem is much worse than what was anticipated.  In general medical office or hospitals give me anxiety, which compounds the issue of worry and anxiousness.","I was in a bad car accident several years ago and have had multiple abdominal surgeries up to this point.  I can and have talked to the doctors about what previous surgeries and procedures were attempted, why they theorized they failed, and I know what options I have to treat my underlying issues moving forward and have explained these during the consultations.",I have had my primary care doctor for 15 years.  Over this time I have built trust in his diagnosis and treatment options.
"I feel confident with obtaining and understanding health information. I have been a caregiver of someone with cancer as well, so I got quite a bit of practice doing so as asking questions was very important. ","What makes me most anxious is just being around people, and having the environment be chaotic and loud. ",An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues is knowing that the reason my mother had so few platelets was because her bone marrow was not functioning correctly and because she didn't have many platelets any kind of even minor injury was dangerous to her because he body was uble to produce more / enough platelets to stop her from bleeding to death.,I trust my doctor because he does not judge me when I bring health issues to him. He is always very thorough in suggesting treatments. He does a good job explaining WHY I am having the symptoms  I am. 
I feel I usually understand  except when the doctor uses big words then I have to come home and look up the words,If I'm worried about money what my bill is going to cost me. Also it depends on the procedure that has to be done,I reAlly  don't know much about medical just what I read when I get info from doctor or look it up online,It seems like doctors only want to pass out pills. That is a bandage and dose not resolve your problem and has side effects
"I feel like have the capacity and understand to understand medical information. However, I always feel like doctors do not take out the time to answer questions properly because I always feel rushed to get out. A lot of the time I find my self researching what the doctors were rushing to explain.",Test results are usually the because factor because I feel like the doctors sometimes focus on the test result and no other factors. I feel like I shouldn't be the only one fighting for my health. ,"My son was born with spina bifida two years ago. Every time I take him to a doctors apartment I have to make medical decisions and asses his progress at home. After his spinal closure as a newborn I had to treat his closure, administer medication, and preform sterile procedures. ",I often feel like They do not full understand that some treatment options although a little safer might cause more of a daily issue for the patient. My physician also shames me on things that I can not control rather than offer help
"I find myself more than adequately intelligent to understand most scientific/biological issues, but the problem lies in the paperwork. I'm never certain as to how to fill it out correctly. The only time I go to see a medical professional is in an emergency due to my lack of financial resources, so it's very intimidating to be VERY ill and be slammed with unfamiliar paperwork.","Knowing that I was unable to ascertain the cause or treatment necessary to overcome whatever the ailment happens to be. Knowing that my literal life is in another person's hands. It is an opportunity for life or death, the gravity of it gets to me.","Any time I try to explain neurological disorders, every face goes blank. I try to break it down even further and make it more simplified, but it seems as though thinking on that scale of body processes is something most people I've come across just can't grasp. Most do not understand the ties between injury, fever, swelling, neuron misfires, cerebro-spinal fluid, etcetera. I have to know theses things due to personal medical history..","If I have taken the steps to be in the presence of a healthcare professional, I have exhausted my own body of knowledge and MUST trust them to investigate further and explain the options for treatment as they may be. Their schooling and Hippocratic oath make them the only option at that point, hence one has no option but to trust someone, why not a trained and certified medical professional. "
"I'm pretty good at understanding health stuff. I understand vaccines are important, second opinions are important for any major health issues/procedures, and I have a firm grasp on information. For example, I have a fibroadenoma, and I understand that it's a non-cancerous tumor that is actually very common, and I understand the ultrasound, sample-taking, and other information that led doctors to conclude that there is a 9999/10000 chance that there's nothing bad going on.","I don't really feel anxious when visiting the doctor. Sometimes there's a weird feedback loop when taking blood pressure where I'm almost nervous that if I'm feeling nervous about my blood pressure being high I'll get an inaccurately high reading, which makes me a little nervous. It's pretty dumb and the nurse and I laugh about it.","I lift weights 3 days per week and do 4+ total hours of cardio per week, in addition to walking at least 7 hours per week (I have a desk job, so even though I'd like more than that, I am content with 7). I do this because I understand muscle mass is important, and can be harder to put on as one ages. Also, strength training can help with bone density, which is useful especially as women age. I also want good cardiovascular health. This is all because people in my family tend to live to be quite old (my great-grandmother is 96!), but not necessarily with a great quality of life, and I want to have a great quality of life as I age.","While I have been lucky to have great doctors whom I trust, and I trust my current doctors, I would say that I do not necessarily trust doctors in general. This is because I understand that doctors are less likely to take women's reported symptoms seriously, medications that may be prescribed are tested much less thoroughly on women than on men, and especially in obstetrics women are not given important information to monitor their own health during/after childbirth which leads to the US having an incredibly high maternal death rate for a first-world country. If I were a man, I would trust medical practices a great deal more. "
"I feel I have a great capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. I attribute this partially to reading comprehension.",I am not sure why I might feel anxious or worried.  ,I had been experiencing anxiety and after attempting to cope with it on my own I filly made that doctor appointment.  I explained my concern with the doctor and she prescribed a low dose of a medication that I had already done some research on.,I trust her because she listens and discusses with me any health issues or concerns I may have. 
"I feel like I can communicate with a doctor about any health problems I might have, but my issue comes in with trying to understand everything.  Also sometimes you get materials that you can take home with you to read, and I feel like those materials just make me more confused.  So while, I may not understand everything, hopefully the doctor knows enough to properly evaluate and treat me.","Probably just fear of the unknown.  While I'm healthy in general, you never know what might happen or what tests may show to the doctor that you are not even aware about.","Well, I had my first child almost two years, prior to getting pregnant with that child, I had an early miscarriage and learned that I also likely have PCOS which could make it difficult to get pregnant again in the future.  Prior to being diagnosed with this I did not know about this issue, but now through those appointments and talking with a couple of friends, I feel like I know a lot more.","She's a professional, she seems to be pretty knowledgeable and she seems really caring.  I just kind of assume that most doctors know what they are doing, so I do not see why my doctor would be any different."
I feel that I have full capacity to recieve and comprehend health information that is given to me. I am able to clarify information if needed and usually ask questions if something is confusing.,Visiting the doctors office rarely makes me feel anxious. If at some point I do feel anxious it might be because the doctor will tell me that I will have to undergo treatment that is not the most convienient for me at the time or I am unfortunately diagnosed with a condition that is not curable. ,An experience that demonstrated my knowledge of health issues was when I took a pre test in my health class in high school. I did well. I like studying health for fun.,"I mostly trust my primary care doctor. I trust them in addressing my concerns and treating my problem appropriately. Sometimes, I feel like doctors differ over what treatment option is best so I get a second opinion."
I am very competent in handling my own health decisions. I have never needed help to date but would not hesitate to ask for help from someone if necessary. ,I worry that I will be repeatedly misdiagnosed. It worries me that she only wants to continuously prescribe medication on top of medications. She treats you like a test dummy with medication. ,I know my own health issues by the symptoms I repeatedly have. I can tell certain flare ups by how I'm feeling at a given moment. ,My primary care physician is quick to prescribe medication and has often overlooked diagnoses when reviewing my records. She schedules appointments 15 minutes apart and then rushes you during your visit.

If not, I would ask questions to clarify the answers.","I always wonder if he will find something that I'm not aware of , that has no symptoms.  This has happened to me years ago so it's always in the back of my mind when I go for a check up.",I'm not sure I have such an experience. I have had knee replacements.  I decided to have both of them done at the same time after the doctor told me I was a good candidate for doing that.  I have often thought since I'm so glad I did.  I'm not too sure I would have ever had the second one done if I did not.,I have been going to my primary doctor for a lot of years and I have come to trust his judgement completely.  I feel he always has my best interests in mind and tells me what to expect.

"I am typically able to understand all the information and am able to ask questions until I fully understand.

I was able to help give him tips on how to help it heal and explain to him what was actually wrong in easier terms than his doctor had.",I will only trust them if I have previously dealt with them. It takes a few visits for me to be able to trust in a doctor. I have encountered some that are only in it for the money and do not care about the patients.
"I'm pretty confident in my ability to obtain, process and understand information. My largest issues would be that I am generally reluctant to go to the doctor unless I absolutely need to, and that I often don't ask too many questions especially when I'm afraid of the answer. I will generally accept instructions from doctor without asking for explations, which probably also limits my ability to make decisions well. To this point, none of this has ever had a negative effect on me.","There's a lot that I don't know when I go into a doctor's office, and I'm often concerned that I'm forgetting to say something that is relevant to my health. I don't know what is and isn't necessary to know, and the whole experience makes me aware of my own frailty and mortality in a way I usually am not.","In college, I took a course, as an economics major, I took a course that was intended for premed students in how to read articles from medical jourls. I did well in the course, although there were clearly gaps in my knowledge because there elements of basic biology, like the brain-blood barrier, that I was almost completely unfamiliar with.","My primary care physician is my uncle, so I've known him my entire life and certainly do not think he'd put any concerns above my health. Also because he's a family member I've had lots of people approach me who are patients of his to tell me how much they trust him as well. As a doctor, he's both extremely careful and reassuring, and very experienced."
Sometimes I feel that I do not have a sufficient understanding of medical terminology to express to a doctor the concerns or problems I am having in a way that will help them to focus their treatment. I feel that often doctors are using a trial and error method of prescribing treatment and think that much of it could be because I am not communicating to them effectively.,"I think that the time constraints upon my doctor visit. I don't know what to discuss with them and it seems that if I bring up too much, I may be charged for an extra visit. And, when I bring up something with my primary care physician, it will probably result in one or more referrals which I prefer to avoid.",I knew when I was pregnant the first morning after I had conceived because I felt different upon my walk to work the next morning. It seemed as though everything I was used to doing took a lot of extra effort. I kept this to myself for several weeks until I was able to take a test and confirm that my personal diagnose was correct.,"Again, I think that the main reason is my inability to 'self-diagnose' and communicate my concerns with them. There is also something of a mistrust of the system within which they work as there are so many constraints upon doctors due to insurance coding and coverage. It seems to interfere with their ability to offer care."
I obtain information very well. I can remember details very easy especially if its about my health. I am very open minded and i always do whats best for myself. Being that i am young i feel like i should be fully aware of every health issue i may have.,I dont normally feel anxious or worried at the doctors. The only time i was infact worried and scared was when i burned my legs.

I would love to have straight answers at all times.,This one here has; it's likely shown how inept I am at math.,"I don't know them well; we're on insurance and don't get top notch treatment, and I don't know the doctors well enough to know how objective they are."
"I try and get all the information I can when I am facing, or if a loved one is facing, a health problem.  I read, I research, I listen to the doctor and nurses (especially to the nurses as they are hands-on,though my doctor explains things well). The written material is not too big a challenge normally, even when  not clearly written - I do ask when it's indecipherable because I need to understand things.","I think I am just allergic to doctor's offices!  I am one of those people whose  blood pressure goes up when tested in the doc's office.  I look at the trays of sharp instruments lying in wait on the counters and I am uneasy!  I have a vivid imagination.  I am anxious about any invasive tests, about possible pain, about possible bad news, esp. as I get older and older.  I have learned to trust my doctor, and as I have reached the age just this year when my yearly physical exam does not have to include a gyn exam, I am much more relaxed.  ","I have raised a family , with two children, who are now 34 and 36 years old.  I faced and dealt with the whole spectrum of childhood mishaps, common illnesses, and accidents, thank God successfully.  Mainly I got good at discerning when medical help was absolutely needed and when I could handle it myself with  ordinary first aid and care.","I have been under this doctor's care for over 10 years.  He inherited me as a patient from my previous physician, who retired. I was one of his first patients and we have become friends.  I have learned to trust him, and have never found his diagnostic instincts to be in error.  He knows when to treat me for a problem, and when to leave me alone.  He is a kind human being and a good physician."
"I think I am able to get all of the information that I need, although sometimes I can not think of what to ask until after the fact. Also at times, I may not completely understand what the doctor or nurse is saying, but I trust their diagnosis and directions for the most part. ","I am sometimes afraid that there will be something seriously wrong with me. I sometimes dread hearing the worst, but so far, it has always turned out just fine. ","When I went with my mom to the doctor about her heart issues, the doctor asked her how often she feels stress. She told him not very often, but I told him that she stresses literally all the time. She sees it as routing worrying, so she didn;t think it was worth mentioning. ","I trust them because they have a lot more knowledge about medical issues than I do. I think most if not all got into the profession to help people, and I dont think they would risk their reputations to harm me. "
"I'M HEALTH PROFESSIONAL, SO I'M PERFECTLY CONFIDENT THAT I UNDERSTAND ALL PRESENTED INFORMATION. ALSO INTERNET IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE IF THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS.","Nothing really makes me feel anxious or worried too much, just a little. I can be worried about getting new diagnosis of something.",There were too many situations like that. Example - I explained to the patients the meaning of the consent forms for experimental treatments.,"All doctors, like all eople, are different. In my lifetime I had to change my doctors due to unprofessional aproach."

"I feel like I have a great degree of capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information. I regularly visit my doctor and they frequently explain any and all tests and treatments, as well as answer every question I have in an easy to understand way. I also know what websites to use for additional information.","When I visit the doctor, I'm most worried about them finding something wrong with my overall health, or even something specific that could really harm me.  I worry I'll need some type of invasive procedure.","When my dad started displaying symptoms of pneumonia, I immediately had him rushed to the hospital.  If I didn't know the signs, he would have gone into septic shock.  My knowledge of health issues likely saved his life.","I trust my doctor because I've been seeing them for almost 10 years and they're familiar with my health and what works best for my body.  Up to this point, they've always given me accurate information and helped me improve my health in a safe way."

I haven't had any issues come up because I've trusted and taken their advice in the past. I don't think they would tell me false information.
"I personally have the capacity but I am very detailed and analytical and they often dail to fully answer my questions to my satisfaction so I often have to conduct my own research and discuss it with them further, sometimes at a subsequent appointment. It would be better if the initial communication was more informative.","During my last pregnancy, OBs would have me stay overnight in the hospital for non-stress testing, simply because they wanted to spend time with their families and didn't want to wait around for the hour it would have taken to observe me. Also, the nurses would tell me to drink water so they wouldn't order an IV, but the doctors always forced me to have an IV, even when I was in the hospital for a short time, drinking water the entire time. Once, the nurse tried to put in an IV three times, permanently damaging my left arm. When she gave up on my left, and starting stabbing my right arm, I was scared I wouldn't be able to use either of my hands the next day. Anyway, all of that was unnecessary and when someone is pregnant in particular, in the US, the doctors only care for the fetus, not the mother. This is why the US has such a high maternal mortality rate...this was told to me by a nurse and public health professional.","I was talking to another patient in my doctor's office about acupuncture in pregnancy and related issues. Apparently my doctor overheard me, and since then has mistaken me for a doula, since I seemed very informed on pregnancy health options.","Primary care is ok but I don't trust OB/GYNs. I had to switch twice at the end of my last pregnancy and was delivered by a midwife. The first OB/GYN was trying to force me to have a c-section for no reason, the second didn't support unmedicated birth and my chiropractor implored me to change to a midwife because she specializes in pregnancy and found that her patients had more success with midwives for unmedicated birth. I also had a doula and the birth was still tense due to the overbearing OBs in the practice, who almost forced me to have a c-section as well. Thankfully my doula was there to fight for me to get the birth I wanted. "
"I feel that I have superior capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions. I tend to do my own research before making decisions, sometimes compiling positives and negatives and balancing them to make the most optimal decision.","I feel most worried that the doctor will find something, maybe it's cancer, or some other neurological disease. But even though logically, I shouldn't worry, it just becomes automatic. ","Having children made me a pseudo expert in diagnosing health issues and adding to my health knowledge. Many times, my children would exhibit symptoms and if they appear benign enough I would go online to check symtoms to self diagnose. While doing that, I've read up and gained a lto of knowledge on many different illnesses and its treatments. ","I trust my primary care physician because he will tell me that I'm doing something wrong. For example, my blood sugars were elevated and he told me directly that if I don't cut down my candy consumption, he will not see me as a patient anymore.

It takes a lot for me to go to the doctor usually so when I do go I get nervous and anxious. ,The most important experience was when I took my state board exams for my PTA license. I had to be well versed in medical terminology as well as diseases and the causes and treatment for each one. Most important was knowing what muscle controls what part of the body. ,I don't have a primary doctor but I do feel that most doctors that I have dealt with of very trustworthy. I haven't had any issues of being mislead of being misinformed over any medical situation. Most doctors I have dealt with seem sincere and show concern.

I understand what doctors tell me and have a general idea of what to fill out on health forms, but there are times when that intersects with insurance and I'm at a complete loss","I don't like waiting to see the doctor, and I don't like the small talk aspect of doctors in their offices. I just want a diagnosis, prescription, and to get out. I respect the medical profession but being in a waiting room full of sick people really makes me not want to go to the doctor at all. ","I can't think of a specific experience off the top of my head, but when I was seeing my psychiatrist, he often tried putting me on anti-depressants I knew wouldnt work because we had disagreements about my symptoms. After several months, he realized I was right.

"Considering the fact that I've had a lot of health issues growing up, I feel im more than capable. Whenever I have questions I'm more than willing to ask my health care provider.

The doctor makes you feel as if you do not know how your body feels,I have a pinched nerve in neck and know when inflamation is severe and am able to ease the pain by doing isometrics.

I also think the medical people do not take ordinary people seriously enough,Doctor never listens to concerns and basically acts superior does not explain anything and rarely rechecks if I still have the symptoms

If I have questions about anything, I ask them.","I think the thing that makes me most anxious is whether something is really wrong or not when I visit my PCP. If I have to wait for results, that is the worse for me. Not knowing is sometimes worrisome and makes me anxious because of the wait.",My dad had problems with his foot after having surgery. This was many years later. He couldn't walk on his foot. I had a coworker that had gout and was experiencing the same symptoms a couple years earlier. I told him that might be what it was and it turned out to be gout.,"I trust my PCP a lot. He has been my PCP since I was a teenager.

I researched and become more knowledgeable on the subject because I wanted to help her. ,I trust the doctor because that is his job.

I think I definitely have the capacity to understand health information and services.  I've never had any problems with that before.,"I don't really get anxious or worried, I just get bored with the long wait and the hassle of it.

He seems perfectly nice but he's usually in quite a rush and makes me feel like I'm a hassle just for being there sometimes.  I don't like that he doesn't remember or check information in my chart, especially since it's a small practice and I've been there for years.

"I feel that I have the ability to process and understand my health information by speaking with my doctors and their office assistants, including visits to specialists and labs. Details I may want to investigate are very often found online.  But when it comes to the fincial aspect of healthcare and health insurance I have often been confused and intimidated.

I ask a lot of questions as well.,"If I have something wrong with me and I can't pinpoint exactly what it is I get a little bit worried, since it might be something serious.  I always get restless when I'm waiting to hear the information that the doctor will tell me. ",When I was extremely overweight and I was feeling like crap whenever  I ate a lot of carbohydrates.

Also I know how to use researching to my advantage when it comes to me making new decisions that I have limited knowledge about.,What makes me feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctors office is the possibility of them finding something wrong with me that I had no idea that I had. It always worries me that I might find out that I have high blood pressure or something even worse that I can't even bring myself to type because its so scary and horrible.,Whenever I go to the doctor. I guess it shows that I usually have no clue until i check with the internet to make sure. I think the internet is a good source to reveal lots of information regarding medical and health issues and it definitely provides lots of information for me to learn about them.,"I feel like I can't trust my primary care physicians completely because sometimes I feel like they do what is more convenient for them and don't put my needs as a patient first which is what I believe should happen, they don't tell all the side effects to a medication and some may not even know all the side effects.

I've had second opinions from colleagues on his diagnosis and treatment recommendations and they usually are consistent with what my colleagues suggest.

The only time this gets confusing is when there is something new/totally unfamiliar.","I get very nervous about hearing bad news. That I am dying, or that my blood pressure is too high. I have always been afraid of doctors.","Growing up, our maid's daughter had epileptic fits. One night in the middle of the night, I was woken up by my sister who was frantic. Janelle, (maid's daughter) was having a fit and I knew enough to keep her from swallowing her tongue using a spoon and then driving her to the ER. (My parents were both out of town).","I mostly trust her, but I feel that she is very rushed and asks few questions. I feel like she does not ask enough questions. This is compared to previous doctors I've had in the past."
"The processing and understanding are rarely an issue, it's really about getting the information I need to do these things that is the problem.

Days later I will get a response from the doctors nurse.",I am always worried that a doctor is not going to hear what I am telling them or ignore my symptoms and play them down.

I am interested in my own health so I try to find out what I can from the doctor during visits. Occasionally I have searched on WebMD and feel I can understand information like this pretty well.,"If I have some unknown pain I might think it is cancer or some other bad disease, but I have been lucky that I haven't had these conditions.",I was told that I have some salt deposits on my kidneys. I drink quite a bit of water now so that I can avoid getting more deposits or worse yet kidney stones.,"I think the doctor I have has made several diagnosis that have been correct about me over the years, so because of that I trust him quite a bit. Doctors do seem to minimize the time they see me in the office but I can forgive that since they are very busy."
"I feel I am capable of understanding what I am told, both written and verbally. I have the ability to ask the questions I want to ask, and to understand the answers. I don't need assistance to understand what I am told, or to fill out any medical paperwork. ","Just general anxiety because I've experienced a lot of incorrect diagnoses, and as a result, been prescribed medicine that has a very negative effect on me. I worry about not being listened to. I dread the patient blame that I've experienced.  ",I'm not sure how to answer this. Unless you mean that I've always been able to understand my own health issues and discuss treatments and issues with the doctors without any assistance. ,"I don't completely trust my pcp. It often seems that if they don't properly diagnose a condition the first time, that they want to blame the patient instead of looking further to figure out exactly what the problem is. I feel like a lot of the time, they can't be bothered to listen, because in their minds, they've already decided what the truth is. "
I think i hav no problem with any of that,Being in a doctors office. ,Never,I dont trust anyone to  be honest but i would hope doctors can be trusted to do what is in the best interest for my health 
"I feel I can do whatever is ask of me, i have a good mind when it comes to answering any questions that are ask of me but I cannot remember what I did a hour later",i think it might be the meds that I take and also because ED it makes you where you done feel much like a man any more,"my mother was killed by breast cancer. She had both breast removed of course her life was never the same and my dads life was changed along with the rest of us, she was one of the 30","my doctor is very through in way he does, he has me come every three months for a check up and to get my meds refilled and every 6 months he does my yearly and checks my blood, urine and checks my prostate"
I'm educated and informed.  I still  have my cognitive powers.  I ask questions when I feel it necessary.  I am not shy.,Very little.  I have had some very difficult diagnoses to contend with.  I trust that whatever the situation is I will survive in one way or another.,"I have been a caregiver for two people, I have taken first aid numerous times in the military and have completed first responder training.  I am not good at math however and the answers above may not be right..........","I trust my doctor to explain completely, to tell me what I need to know.  He does not trust alternative treatments very much.  I check with another health professional (whom I trust) about those options."
I feel very comfortable with basic health information. I've never really had a problem with not being able ot understand something or not getting the information i needed. ,I don't get too anxious at the doctors office unless I feel very sick. In that case I'm usually already worried about my health. ,I took a nutrition class in undergrad. My health law class in law school touched upon medical procedure (but not in great detail). I have also lost about 70 pounds which demonstrates my knowledge of diet and exercise. ,"I just switched to a new PCP after a move. I have a very pleasant visit with my new doctor and I felt he was honest, listened to my concerns and friendly. "
I am not much of a verbal learner. Someone explaining something to me is far less likely to stick than if I can read the information and absorb it myself. I am a researcher.,"Most things make me anxious, so it is not necessarily a special occasion. I do not do well with uncertainty, so if it something beyond a checkup or the like, enter: anxiety.","A little over a decade ago, I injured my knee. I knew it was bad, but I didn't go to the hospital for a few days. In the meantime, I gave myself my own diagnosis, and it was later confirmed by a doctor.","I feel like we almost have no choice but to have a general trust in our doctors, right? Otherwise, what else is there? I am not naive enough to believe that there aren't plenty with special interests and motivations beyond doing their jobs well and with care, but a certain trust has to exist."
"I feel that I have a great understanding for myself. If I had doubts, I would look up term that were confusing.",I have a stalker and I don't trust due to not knowing who knows him. I don't give out any personal info to avoid being found. ,I broke out in hives and couldn't breathe. The newest thing added to my routine was a bodywash that turned out to be the problem.,I believe in no man 100%. They make mistakes just as I do and I can't see looking to someone else to validate me.
"I feel like some medical information was not written for the average person to understand. I feel the same way about some explanations that doctors give. However, it also makes me feel somewhat foolish to ask for additional information.",I know that I'm not as healthy as I should be so any visit to the doctor makes me worry that I am going to hear bad news. ,I go to the doctor's office for check-ups and stuff. I also live with my grandma who is very health conscious.,I feel like doctors are very much about profit for themselves. I don't think that they have my best interest at heart a lot of the time.
"I have so many health problems due to the Lupus, Sjogren's, and frequent infections. There are so many terms and conditions I am experiencing it is hard sometimes to retain the information. I oftentimes have to ask for clarification. I also have IBD and liver issues. Even if a doctor is rude, and I have had plenty of mean ones, I ask everything I can think of. It could be a matter of life and death, or just not feeling well. I have to get over my embarrassment and intimidation and ask what I need to. ",I have had so many of them refuse to treat me I am scared every time I walk in. I have had to travel around states and the country finding care. I am fully aware I may not get treated and not to take it personally. I am tired of being called crazy or a liar when I am really sick and NOT feeling well.,"I suddenly broke out in bronchospasms and uncontrolled life-threatening allergic reactions. No medication or allergy shots could help. My ANA was constantly positive. I insisted I had Lupus and pushed to be seen. The doctor gave me blood work and diagnosed me with SLE. Since then, my health problems have gotten worse, even with the Plaquenil.","I have had many bad doctors. I use a mouth guard during the day for stress, and doctors have treated me like a mental patient. Many doctors have refused to treat my infections because they have treated me before. My immune system is bad. I have had doctors call the police on me and lie, saying I hear voices and want to die. I never told anyone that. A majority of them have been bad. "
I feel I have the ability to understand the services needed to make appropriate health decisions because I know how to listen and understand things easily. When learning something new you always listen and ask as many questions you need to. ,"When I was pregnant and I had upcoming test like for diabetes, group b strep,and etc. I get worried because I wanted to have a healthy pregnancy.","I learned that while pregnant, you can get anemia. I was one of those people and when I was pregnant I had to take a iron supplement or when I go into labor I would have to have a blood transfusion. Luckily I listened to the doctors advice and came out with two healthy baby girls. ","I trust my doctor because they never give me a reason not to. They show me everything I need to know. They have a website where I can see all my medical records, what test they ran and how they I did on it. My doctor is the best!"
"In my opinion, I have a high degree of capacity to obtain and coherently process my health information. I've thus far accurately understood my treatment plans and executed effective decisions that have had great outcomes.","The potential for a negative visit usually is what bothers me the most. If I've never been to a particular doctor's office, their demeanor mostly gives me cause for worry.","I care for my mother moderately. She is independent and usually takes care of herself but doesn't have information on important health facts. One afternoon she described to me how she had had difficulties pouring her coffee, she explained how she had to hold one arm with the other to even lift minimally. I insist recognized the symptoms of stroke. We went to the ER where they did find she had a stroke.",I have been with my primary care physician for a long period of time.  I have gained a healthy relationship and trust level with her. She has always giving me straight-forward advice and information. Whenever I've asked of side effects or possible outcomes she has always giving me the knowledge and confidence the positive effect greatly out way the negative.
i have the ability to understand this information because my physician explains all conditions and information to me,that i may have something that is not easy to talk through and hard for my physician to explain to me,"i have very little experience but i am currently a biology major at the college i attend, helps me to pick up some information from books and assignments other than what mt physician explains to me ",i trust my primary care physician because they answer any questions i have and we talk over anything

May have to take more meds.,Had a CAT scan which showed nodules. This could be caused mainly by three things. I now have enough information about nodules,Have had the same doctor for 20+ years. Always has been on the ball. Good with reminders and any updates.
I am always a little confused when it comes to medical things. I often have lots of questions for the doctors and nurses but they often never answer them all fully.,That things are worser than she is saying. She had no compassion and offered very little explanation and didn't want to take the time to further explain,I don't really have experience other than researching stuff on my on on the Internet. That is the extent of my medical knowledge.,I think doctor's are overworked and don't ave time to create caring relationships with their patients
I believe I have the ability and capacity to obtain anything I need. I am pretty self sufficient and able to take care of my own stuff. ,I'm fat. They always tell you that you need to lose weight or die. ,I studied about cannibis oil and COPD for my mom. She has been taking it and has improved greatly. ,I honestly don't trust anyone. I believe what they say is helpful but holistic approaches are good too. 
I feel I am quite knowledgeable about my health problems and can understand what is said to me,"I always feel like they will find something else wrong with me, I take enough meds now","when I was having an extremely hard time breathing I knew something was wrong, I went to the hospital and discovered that I had two PE's in my right lung. I knew it was more than my asthma and I knew it was in my right lung.","I don't like or trust her, she comes in looks at my chart prescribes another pill and walks out without hardly talking to me."
"This is all just basic common sense and intelligence which most people have the capacity to perform, unless mentally challenged due to age or a mental defect, or if a small child.","If I have been very ill for a long time and there has been nothing to help me for a long time, I would worry wondering if the test results would show some dangerous illness like cancer, aids, etc. which could kill me soon.","I have been very ill twice before in my life and thought I would die, I have seen many doctors in my life as well bot my parents who are no longer with me suffered terribly and I was with them, i.e. trips to the hospitals and conversations with doctors","I never trust anyone completely, however I truly believe that most doctors are truthful and honest or the most part when talking to the clients"
Yes if not I will look the information up or ask for help or have Husband explain it to me or I will ask the Nurse to write down or give me a brochure about the condition or what ever I need help looking up,You never know what they are going to tell you or the next step in progress or if something isn't right and have to change your life goals,Allergies thought it might of been from dog dander but wasn't so was glad it wasn't cause she sleeps with us,Listen to my questions by verbal or notes and they give me eye contact not ignore me and also give me advice of things to try out before the next step and have me at times look up information on line if I don't understand what they are talking about
"When dealing with health information and services, it's unlikely for an individual to be familiar with all the medical terminology. As such, it's important to ask the appropriate questions and aid if they're confused or questioning the instructions. Failure to do so can lead to errors, which will waste time and money for all involved.","Visiting the doctor's office, one usually feels apprehensive. The reason for this is that there's always a chance they can find something else wrong than what currently ails an individual. In other words, while I'm seeking treatment for one problem, I may end up having multiple reasons for my sickness.","When in a pharmacy or store searching for over-the-counter medicine, it is up to the individual to decide what they require. No doctor is available to give advice, only the knowledge you currently have, and the information on the labels. From having children, I've grown accustomed to reading and interpreting these labels on children's medicine.","I trust my primary care physician. I've known my doctor for years and haven't had a bad experience dealing with the doctor or doctor's office in general. The information I've been given thus far has been correct and helpful.

"I feel confident in my ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information. I will not approve of services that I don't fully understand the reason for or fully agree with the risks. i.e.risk vs. benefit","It depends on the reason for the visit. If it is for a minor ailment, there is no reason to be anxious. I have no reason to feel anxious about a visit unless I the doctor gives me reason to be. i.e. bad health news","I have a child with Autism. A close childhood friend of mine has a son about a year older than my own. After my son was officially diagnosed, she and I would compare our boys' behaviors. She insisted that her son exhibited the same characteristics that diagnosed my son with Autism; however, her doctors would not acknowledge her son's symptoms. Several years later, her son received and official Autism diagnosis and was able to receive beneficial services.","I have a great general physician, but I typically like to research my conditions and then review options with my doctor before making a decision. If I disagree, I seek a second opinion. "
i will ask a doctor for anything that i need to know regarding documents that i need to sign and anything else that is needed to know or explain. ,i don't like waiting for results especially if it was for something that might be serious. ,when i was getting checked for my blood pressure i knew what it meant when they told me the measurements ,i trust my doctor knowing that he/she had medical training and education and i don't 
Fairly confident in asking questions and asking that the answers be relayed in terms I can understand.

None of my physicals have ever revealed any problems so my physicals are not a source of dread or anxiety.,Had a broken leg due to being hit on a bicycle.  Understood the procedures I needed to go through in addition to physical therapy requirements.,"Overall, I trust my primary physician but I don't think they always want to commit to a detailed answer."
"I feel that I have a reasonable understanding of health information and services; however, I do feel that there is a lot that I do not know or understand.  Sometimes I feel rushed and don't feel like I have the time to ask all of the questions that I would like.  ",My family has an extensive history of health issues and each time I go to my doctor I am concerned that he is going to find something or diagnose a condition.  Often times I am waiting on the test results to see if everything is fine or not and that makes me anxious.,I had a blood clot and was told by the walk-in care that it was just a bug bite.  I researched my symptoms on my computer and determined that it appeared to be a blood clot.  I went to a different hospital and they agreed.  I was immediately admitted for my condition and it ended up saving my life.,I feel like I can trust my primary care physician because I do not sense that he would provide bad advice.  I do sometimes have concerns because while his intentions are good he might not be aware of every condition or treatment option.  Sometimes I feel like seeing a specialist is the best alternative.
"I feel I understand it quite well. If I have a question I don't hesitate to ask someone. Some of it can be confusing at times, always ask if uncertain. So far in me life I have had no problems understanding and processing health information.",Finding out what is wrong with me. Or having him find something new that is devastating.

He doesn't rush, or ignore my questions."
I'm fully capable of obtaining and understanding anything related to basic health information. If I have questions about something I will research it myself online before I talk to and question my doctor. I think this combition of internet and doctor makes it very easy to do.,I am not anxious or worried at all when I visit the doctor's office. There is not point in it. If something is wrong then worrying about it isn't going to help the situation get any better.,"Recently I was feeling heart palpitations out of nowhere. I had never felt them before in my life and I got concerned about it. In the end, after doing some research, I concluded that I needed to shed a couple of pounds and quit drinking caffeine. Once I did this the heart palpitations stopped.",If I didn't trust my PCP then I would look elsewhere (as I have done in the past). One of the most important aspects of a PCP is trust. If I can't trust him/her then the relationship is worthless to me.
"I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand most basic health information and services needed to make the right health decisions.  When I have doctor appointments, I always take a list of questions I have so that I can better understand the health information given to me.  On occasion when I am incoherent due to aftereffects of being put under for surgery, for example, my husband goes with me so that he can also hear the information in case I didn't grasp all that the doctor was telling me.","What makes me feel most anxious when visiting the doctor's office is lack of communication.  For example, if you are waiting in the waiting room or exam room and nobody (nurse or doctor) communicates that there will be a delay or explain why there's a delay.  Overall, the most anxious I feel is any lack of communication from the medical person.",An experience in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of a medical issue was based on when I had uterine cancer.  A friend called me and told me her symptoms and I told her it sounded like she had the same thing and she did.,"I generally trust my primary care physician yet I realize that any final decisions about my health (including treatments, medicines, etc.) are my choice to make.

Filling out basic health information is not a problem for me. My weakest area is asking questions so that I understand exactly what the doctor/nurse is saying. Sometimes I just don't know the right questions to ask.,"I don't want to hear any bad news, so it is a little worrisome to have an examition by a doctor. However, if it is a problem which is rather simple like a cold or the flu, then I'm not too worried about those situations.",I was diagnosed with kidney stones 25 years ago. I can now recognize when a kidney stone attack is coming on by paying attention to the symptoms my body gives such as blood in the urine and change of stools.,"I really like my doctor and have been going to her for several years. However, there was one time when she misdiagnosed a problem I was having. Perhaps part of the problem was the way I described the situation. However, she put me on some medication which, after reading about it, I felt wasn't necessary at all.

Completely understand everything that I am told by the doctors and nurses and confident that the appropriate decisions are made.,I hate to sit for hours and hours just so they can tell you that your doctor is not there and you got to see a nurse practitioner that has absolutely no clue what you discussed with the doctor,I don't know what you think I'm going to tell you I don't know what to say I don't know how many characters this is I have no clue what you are talking about I hope this is a mini characters as I need,Most doctors want to tell you stuff that will keep you coming back to see them.

I'm nervous that I'll be scolded for not being perfect.","I have many years of experience with common illnesses like the cold or the flu, so I can recognize the symptoms and know the treatments.

It involves a lot of calculations and familiarity with symptoms.","I feel that my doctor is generally knowledgeable and competent; I just think that sometimes my sessions are rushed through, as if I'm just another customer to pay for their services. I don't distrust my doctor, but I do often believe that my doctor should spend more time with me."
I'm pretty confident. But I always ask to make sure everything is good. I want to make sure everything is right.,I always think there is something wrong with me. I'm a little hypochondriac. I think everybody feels the same way when they go to the doctor,I had few test about my pregnancy and miscarriages before. I can understand some of the lab result but most I have to ask my doctor about them,I trust my doctor because he helped me a lot with my past medical issues. He always explain everything to me.
I am reasonably intelligent and well-informed with no difficulties getting the information I need to make good health care decisions.,"I have severe anxiety in all things, but nothing at my general practitioner's office elevates that anxiety.","Look, I have to see both a psychiatrist and a psychologist once a month and my GP every six months, not counting sick visits.

"I feel I have the capacity to understand most things I receive, my issue is that medical professionals either don't listen when I ask a question or if they hear it, they half answer it or rush through the explanation. A lot of the time, I find myself going to Web MD after a visit to try and get more detailed information. Medical professionals are often too busy to take the time and answer you thoroughly and I can tell they are trying to hurry me through the appointment. Some written material I don't read, as it's repetitive and the font is like 1/2 point.  ","Being told that something is severely wrong with me. I just had this happen recently when I went for a physical and ANS turned up positive (auto immune issue). I still have to go to another lab for a more detailed test and I've been putting it off since I kind of dread it, plus, it's is a hassle. I'm also always uneasy when I'm getting examined I don't have a specific reason, I just don't like it. I also hate getting undressed and having the whole staff in and out and you are sitting there naked in a paper gown. ","When I had acute bronchitis and acute sinusitis. I was sick for months and kept telling people it was that (since I get it a lot) but people doctors included, kept saying it was just a bad cold. I mean, I know myself and I knew it was bad. People at work thought I was just calling out for no reason until I brought the note from my doctor, who was going to put me into the hospital if the last of 4 antibiotics tried did not work. It finally took breathing treatment, CIPRO, and getting a swab up my nose before I finally started getting better. ","I think he's okay; my main thing with him is he always wants to send me to a specialist. I know myself, I am not going to make 14 different appointments to get a PAP, a colonoscopy, a mammogram...it's just too much hassle. I would rather have all my health checkups done at one place. He does listen, but doesn't delve into things, like I take wellbutrin and I'm not sure that is the solution but he doesn't ask me about or recommend anything else. He's a nice guy, I'm just not overly enamored of him but it's too much work to find another Doctor. "
"I know how to ask and answer questions. I have a fundamental understanding of medical terms and conditions, enough to pose and answer most questions.","Fear of the unknown when experiencing symptoms. More so a problem of ""How long will I have to wait today?"" for a routine physical examination.",I have an auto immune condition that primarily attacks septuagenarian males. I have studied the condition in great detail using medical resourses.,"She considers information provided and what she sees. She is a known, competent authority and a worthwhile resource. That reputation has been earned over the years."

Sometimes my mind wanders to the worst medical conditions.,I have had discussions with people in the health profession but I am not sure what you are asking in this question.,I have never had any experience to make me not trust my doctor. Most of the time I think he is trying to do what is best to treat whatever is the wrong in the most effective way.

"I feel that I have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information if it is given to me in a way that I can understand. Some doctors are not very good at relaying things in layman's terms which can cause some confusion at time. If this happens, I try to remember to ask any pertinent questions that I do not feel were addressed adequately. Overall, I feel that I am very capable of processing health information given to me. It can at time, however, be overwhelming.  ","When visiting the doctor's office, I am afraid that I may get some news that could be very bad. I am also afraid that I may have not been following the doctor's orders as I should and he may be upset with me. I am also afraid of the costs that may be incurred.  I am also afraid of needles so the thought of a shot is upsetting. ","One experience that demonstrates my knowledge is understanding terms given to me by my doctor when he was explaining my hypertension diagnosis. As I was a biology major in college, I have understanding of much of what he was saying. I also have a family history of hypertension so I know a lot of the terms as my mother was very familiar with it during her life and I heard her discuss it while she was living. ","Doctors some times are required to focus on the bottom line and cost cutting rather than the well-being of patients.

I feel i understand things completely but doctors dont listen and just recommend things based on the massive consumption of what they see and i am a number that is not listened to. Although good intentioned doctors are overwhelmed with inputting info so as to not get sued. This is a shame because all that school and minimal output from fear and bad information.,Because they hold the key to knowledge i am unaware of so giving up control to random people is fearful and naked.

I know that pharmaceutical companies incentivize physicians to prescribe drugs for pretty much everything and so I always fear that there is a Ã¢ÂÂwitch huntÃ¢ÂÂ in progress as a physician to look for reasons to prescribe and considers which drugs to use.","An experience I had in my life that demonstrated my knowledge of health or medical issues was when I when my toddler daughter fell from a tree and cut her arm. She was frantic but I observed that the cut was relatively minor, was an isolated injury, did not appear to need stitches and there were no apparent breaks or rapid swelling. I soothed her tears by reassuring her as I cleaned her cut thoroughly and applied pressure to stop the bleeding. Then I applied a sterile bandage to the wound and walked her through some gentle range of motion maneuvers to verify that her wrist and elbow were unaffected. Since everything checked out OK, I determined that a trip to a physician was probably not necessary. I cleaned and dressed the wound, changed her bandage over the following week, and her healing progressed without incident.","I am currently between primary care physicians because my insurance coverage and physical location has changed several times recently. But when I did have a regular primary care physician(s) which I did for many years, I felt that in general I could trust them. However, in all cases I do my own research and use logic whenever possible. I try to avoid any and all medications, which I feel is too often the focus of physicians, to push drugs. For that reason, I canÃ¢ÂÂt say that I ever have complete trust in a doctor.  I take pretty much anything a physician might say or do with a Ã¢ÂÂgrain of saltÃ¢ÂÂ, always considering the possibility that the drug factor could be playing a significant role."
"Although I've made a few trips to the doctor, and my children were delivered in a hospital, I primarily manage my own health. After dealing with chronic, and ultimately fatal, illness in both my parents, I was motivated to educate myself on proactive means to maintain my health so I don't need to see health care professionals. This has worked very well for me for 30 years, and I hope it continues to do so. But yes, I have a lot of knowledge about the current western medicine, to the point I had one of my mother's doctors ask if I was a medical professional. I said , ""No, but I guess you could say I am a 'lay' professional. :-)""","My primary issue with having current Western medical practices applied to me is that medical schools do not address a wide enough spectrum of healing modalities. And if they do, they charge a lot for their services. Around here, MD/NDs charge far too much for me to afford. So, I'm left with the choice of visiting a doctor who is instructed in a more narrow treatment spectrum, which does not suit my approach to health. As a result, I'm worried and anxious, because I know how many doctors react if you question their advice.","When my mother was battling cancer, she had a black out spell. My daughter living in California called me to come home (I was in Utah at the time). I got their as quick as I could, about a day later, and went straight to my mom in the hospital. I talked over her condition with her doctor and he was confident due to my responses that I understood what she needed and I could take her home.","I do not have a primary care physician, therefore I marked all of the above items as neutral. I've personally been friends with several doctors in my life, and the reality is they are people like everyone else, and as a result my trust in them depends on their ethics and character. Some doctors are very caring and insightful, some are full of ego that blinds them truly looking and understanding a case before them. And all degrees in between. Should I ever need to see a doctor, I will to a great deal of research on them before consenting to be their patient."
I let the health professionals explain the condition to me . If I have any questions I will ask them at the appointment. When I go home I process what they told me and if I need to mske another apt I do so and ask them to calify and issue I have ,If my doctor calls me and tell me she need to see me regarding my test result I feel that it is not good news . Most times this is not so she just wants to go over the results with. Me ,I always go to my primary doctor ever year to get a physical examination. I ask her to draw my blood and get a flu shoot ,I trust my doctor because they explain any thing to me .if I need further info they will obtain it for me 
I understand everything that is explained and if I don't know I'll ask. I'm not that old. And if I have my doubts then I'll get additional information about the things I need to know.,If my medical insurance will cover the cost of the bill. Also coverage of medication and whatever tests are to be performed,Im not a doctor you know. So i didnt quite answer the correct ones.

I have had not difficulty up until now and have helped other people find information at times. ","I just generally don't like interacting with people on a very personal level.  I don't like to be touched, I like to be private.  Getting undressed in front of a stranger in a strange place and having them poke and prod and examine me asking personal questions is semi traumatic.  ","My knowledge of health or medical issues mostly revolves around being able to look up information on various conditions or reading information being given by doctors.  I take no prescriptions, have not had any major illnesses nor been significantly injured. ",I do not have a stable primary care physician at this time.  With doctors in the past it generally seems as if they are just handling another number in line and waiting to get through to the next person and the person after that.  They generally don't seem to listen very well.

He has always helped me with my health and known the right things to do.
There are times where I am unsure of exactly what the forms are asking. I feel like doctors talk too fast at times trying to explain and then rush out to the next patient. I have a general understanding and feel like I can figure out how to get health information or assertive enough to ask for help. ,"Doctors usually are hurried and that makes me anxious. I usually have questions and I'm worried that I won't have time to ask them. Or I worry about whether the doctor will listen to me and help me. I have been dismissed so often by doctors, especially for my children. ",I have given birth to two children. My youngest has had a host of health issues and we've seen several different specialists and had different therapies. My mom was an LPN and would talk about different things when we had questions. I also will research when there is something that is concerning or an issue I have. ,I don't care for my primary car physician. I feel like I am just a number as she quickly would complete my visit and rarely answer questions. When I truly had a need she didn't have any advice for me and didn't offer to converse with her colleagues to find out.She also didn't listen to me and caused me several scares during my first pregncy. I haven't seen my PCP in 6 years because of it. 
Suffering from cognitive brain issues from having chemotherapy and radiation from cancer and surgery. I wasn't able to get the care needed to recover due to my insurance and the lack of knowledge of Cedars Sinai of chemo brain issues,I don't get anxious or worried visiting doctors. I know if I don't get the care that is needed from my doctor then I need to go to emergency to get the right kind of care.,I'm not a doctor. I go to the doctor to get treated for medical conditions. The doctors are the ones that are practicing medicine. All I do is tell them how I feel to best help them be able to know what's wrong with me.,I have a new doctor and she has too many patients. She hasn't returned my call. She doesn't take time needed to get all the facts and needs to cut the amount of patients she has to be able to practice medicine effectively.
"I feel like I have the tools available to understand what I need to know, however those tools are not always connected. For instance, when I am with the dr. I do not always think of the question I need to ask. When the dr gives me information to read at home, the questions prompted would be better asked in the office. When I look up information on-line, I rarely print the information to take in and discuss. ","I think for me there is always the fear of what will they find that I don't know about, the what if something is really wrong fear. Other than that the exam, albeit uncomfortable at times is not really an issue. ","4 years ago my mom had brain surgery for a tumor. After working in the medical device industry for 12 years I was much more comfortable talking to the doctors and asking questions than my parents were. Doctors are humans and normal folk, I am ok talking and questioning them. I think this is most important, even beyond knowing what to do or how to treat. I knew what questions to ask: follow up plans, treatment pathways, altertive options, long term side effects. And I was able to get enough information to plan. ",I think my trust comes mainly from the time my dr. is willing to spend with me. She takes the time to talk and get to know me and what my life looks like. She integrates any options into what works in my situation. 
I am well able to understand matters concerning my health and any instructions given by the doctor are is team. I can read and understand most anything. ,I always have a little unease that they may find something that is not right.

He explains the side effects of medications before prescribing them to me, and allows me to decide on what I believe would be the best treatment for myself"
I am fully capable of asking and answering physicians questions. I understand hippa and most anything that has to do with most medical diagnoses and conditions. If I didn't know a question to ask or if the doctor didn't give me the info I felt I needed I'm pretty positive I can find resources to obtain what I need. ,Nervous about whether they would give me bad news or not. Nervous that they may not be able to correctly diagnose any ailments I may have. Worried they may miss diagnose what ailment I may be having ,Took care of my grandmother who had dementia and currently take care of my mother who has had multiple surgeries is on dialysis has kidney disease and has had several strokes,I would only choose a doctor if I believed in them and what they stood for and whether they were competent enough to take care of me the way I should be taken care of. If I get a hint of a wrong feeling about a physician I will definitely not use them
I have a long history with the medical community so I am fluent in the language. I have had many surgeries and procedures over the years.  ,Not being able to get encouraging results or solutions to improve my health or relieve my pain   Most of my conditions are chronic and will not improve ,I had a brain aneurysm and an AVM in my front left lomb the blood vessels were mangled from birth.  This malformation is what saved my life when I had the aneurysm because the blood couldn't gust out ,I have had a long relationship with  of my doctors. I can depend on them to answer all my questions and give me their honest opinion 
"I believe I can handle all the healthcare information myself. I am a mother and have spent my life covering health issues for my children, and sadly my husband also. Because I put myself in that position, I spent a lot of time figuring out how to deal with all the decisions and paperwork and communication that were needed to deal with health issues. ","I am always concerned that they will find something that will require further testing. In my past experience, further tests can be expensive and painful, and for me have always turned out fine. But even still, it is scary to decide to ignore the doctor's advice and not do further tests. ","I guess I would return to my earlier statement in that I am a mother who spent a lot of time dealing with everyone's health issues in my family. I have also taken care of helping my parents because they are aging and get confused. I wouldn't say that I feel completely comfortable with everything related to health decisions, but if I have questions, I ask and I also do a lot of research before I make decisions. I have had to do additiol testing in the past for health issues, and I felt comfortable with my choices after I dug deeply into the issues myself. Ultimately I am the one who wants to decide what happens to me, either good or bad.","I have a medical condition that has been ongoing for years. The last time I went to visit the doctor, I asked her about what procedures I should do for that issue. She said to me that she hadn't seen that in my chart, went and checked, and seemed surprised that I had that condition. I have been seeing her the whole time. Then when she gave me instructions about procedures and what I should do next, she also gave me the last set of test results from the past year, and there was some disturbing results that should have been followed up on at the time. Needless to say, we followed up on them then but it could have been catastrophic for me if the results turned negative, which thankfully they didn't."
"I believe I am very capable to get and understand medical information. Although, I sometimes get overwhelmed due to anxiety and it makes it difficult to focus my thoughts and sometimes it affects my vision (blurred).","I have anxiety regularly, but I also hate being the sole focus in any situation. Plus, I don't like exposing myself due to a childhood trauma. I am sure that my distrust of my PCP adds to his anxiety. ","Other than high school biology presentations, I have had to switch doctors and apply/appeal for disability and unemployment several times over the last 2 years. I successfully talked about my condition to Social Security and was awarded benefits. Also everytime I've switched doctors, I didn't have transferable records so I have to to recount details of my diagnosis. ","My PCP just seems to have a diagnosis ready to go before we even speak. He rarely seems to be concerned with side effects I report and love to have tests run. His focus just seems very narrow, he is late and just dismissive. "
"I am able to obtain, process and understand basic health information which is explained by my doctor or in basic medical reports.  I am unable to understand test results that have shorthand, acronyms etc. that are specific to the medical field.  I do, however ask my doctor to explain any test results or language that I do not undferstand.","I am always afraid that my doctor will find an ailment or serious illness.

For a while, seemingly, my doctor found some health problem with most visits.  This has made me a little anxious about test results and examinations.",Breast cancer taught me how little I know about the cancer and its treatments.

I believe that, in general doctors have become salesmen.  They are very quick to prescribe medication and refer patients to doctors to patients who refer patients to them.  I do not feel that anyone should completely that in these days of greed and avarice, no one should blindly entrust his/her healthcare to another human being."

"I am currently uninsured. I have Graves Disease so, have seen many doctors in the past. The disease itself is a little hard to understand but I ask all of the questions I have and usually get fairly clear answers.","I suppose there is a degree of the unknown. They is always the possibility of them finding something unexpected. Overall, I'm comforted to see a doctor and know they are looking after me.","I have a mammogram that was a false positive. My doctor ordered very vigorous tests. Although I was concerned, I felt pretty strongly it was a false positive because I regularly check my breasts and pay attention to changes in my body. As it turned, I was correct. ","I am uninsured and haven't seen a doctor for 14 months. When I do, I like my doctor very much. He is thoughtful and attentive, speaks in normal civilian language, not medical terms I can't understand. He takes all of the time I need."
I am fairly confident in understanding the descriptions of medical issues that the doctors describe. If I don't understand I am sure to ask the meaning of certain issues.,"I don't have health insurance, so the most troubling issue that I have is paying my health care bills. The second issue is that my doctor is young and seems very quite, she isn't very vocal with comforting me in my medical issues.",I became a certified nurses assistant when I was 18 years old and also became a emergency room secretary at Florida hospital when I was 19 years old. My mother was a physical therapist and spoke in medical terminology often.,My primary care physician seems inexperienced and doesn't give an educated opinion of my symptoms. She doesn't ask many questions of give helpful solutions to my medical problems.
"I am 100 percent sure that I can handle these tasks without the help of others. I know what to expect from my office visits, lab results and any other services that I may encounter. I communicate very well with my doctors, nurses and other office personnel.","When I have an issue and I don't know what area of my body has to be checked. This happens when I can't quite explain what's bothering me Or having to explain what kind of pain I'm having whether it be  sharp, dull, burning, etc.",Some times it's hard for me to tell if I hve a kidney infection or a rinary tract infection.When I get one of these infections it is easy for me to tell which is whic before I make a trip to the doctor's office. ,"My doctor has been a ""lifesaver"" on several occasions for. Without him/her I don't know if I would have survived without my doctor and some divine intervention. My doctor has always answered my questions to my satisfaction and fully explained my issues. When my doctor thought that I needed a second opinion there was a quick referral."
"Yes, I definitely have the capacity to understand any and all information pertaining to my health and the ability to make decisions that would help me maintain my health all by myself.",I only worry when I leave the doctor's office if I am waiting on test results or have left with more questions .,i do not have a lot of experience with health or medical issues because i have always been really healthy.,I trust that my doctor has my best interests at heart. I have often had many questions and my doctor always had time to answer them and give me as many options as I needed to make health decisions.
I think I have a fairly decent understanding of basic health information and services to make appropriate decisions. If there is ever something that I do not understand someone is always around to get the correct information. ,"you never know if they might find cancer. You could go to the doctor for something you think is probably minor, but it is actually something really bad",when I was sick with a respiratory illness I mad fresh garlic tea and fresh chopped garlic releases allicin which is good medicine,For the most I trust my physician. I do think that doctors need to spend more time with there patients. 
"I think I am starting to understand important health information. Before I filly found good health insurance, I ended up reviewing a ton of possible health conditions I could have before filly going to the doctor.  These supposed conditions prepared me for the future conversations I would receive at the doctors. ",Diabetes runs in my family.  I want to make sure that I never get that disease ever in my life. I'm always anxious at the thought of the doctor telling me that I have diabetes whenever I come in. ,"I spent a half a year researching if I had diabetes or not.  I found out a lot of things that contributed to diabetes, so I lost weight and balanced out my hormones. I also looked into people who reversed diabetes.  This saved me from the disease. ",I've been lucky enough to have a female doctor who understands my female health related issues.  I trust this person for the most part.  I understand that people are not perfect.  
Yes been in the healthcare for over 16yrs myself  so my understanding of things and medical terminology is quite clear.,The only time I would worry is if I  get bad news or bad lab results I'm a pretty healthy young lady and shouldn't get any bad news concerning my health ,Had surgery on gallbladder was in. A lot of pain but need relief so surgery was my only option I went along with the procedure and 19 years later I feel wonderful ,Sometimes physicians give unnecessary treatment and sometimes they are on point with treatment with my personal experience I always recommend a second opinion 
I feel like I can get whatever information I need in all areas of the health field. I can ask my doctors or the nurses about my conditions or that of my daughter's or even my husband's. I can make appropriate health decisions based off the information I am given.,What makes me feel the most anxious or worried in a doctor's office would be the fact that they will be giving me news on something I don't wanna hear or they are telling me I'm going to have to give labs and give blood.,Well I have a certification in medical transcription and just other things by asking questions from those that have gone thru nursing school or looking it up myself.,I trust my primary care physician cause they always lay it down straight forward in front of me about my conditions and the treatment options I have.
all I fully understand and comprehend everything I have answered thus far very easy I was asked have I ever had difficulty understanding anything dealing with info giving at doctors appointment rather it be nurses or doctors.,if they will tell me something bad or if I have to set another appointment if they found something doctor visits in itself or just nerve wrecking,when my son hadd a lumpin his neck i understood what the possibilties could be and knew the signs and did thorough research before hand,I have to that's who I go to and chose if I feel that the trust is not there then I will should change I don't fully put my trust in just a doctor them selves I have to trust me as well
totally have the ability to answer questions and get information needed to be decisions that are best for me,if I have a new symptom then I get nervous since I have had cancer twice already. I worry that there is a new cancer or the old one has come back. ,i was diagnosed with cancer and had to answer a lot of questions and continue to do so throughout my treatment through the years. ,my doctor is there for me when I need him to be - he takes the time to listen to me and answer and questions I might have. 
I've worked in healthcare related fields for most of my life so my medical terminology is pretty good. I'd say I understand what's being told to me more than the average person. ,Mainly just the fear of a bad diagnosis. ,"I'm currently a foster parent to a one year old and recently had to make the choice of whether to seem medical care for a fever in the middle of the night. From working in the ER for so long, I knew the best place to start was alterting tylenol and motrin.","I like and trust my doctor, I've been a patient of his for several years. I trust his judgement and diagnosis although I also know sometimes doctors are just guessing. "
"I can do it, but I'm unsure about myself sometimes, and there are times where i don't understand what is happening","the fact that people know i'm going in there, as well as letting the doctors know my body. because that sucks, i hate my body","all i'm wondering rn is why the math questions man. i mean, what, i'm not that smart. dude, just why.","they know better than me about stuff, because i'm still a student...so. and i'm not studying their field, either..."
"I feel it to a moderate degree. When in doubt, I usually consult with my sister, who is a nurse practitioner. ",I don't feel anxious or worried when I visit the doctor's office.,"For a good portion of 2015, I was sick. I had a fever, cold, body aches, etc. at least twice a month. Last year, I started eating about five cloves of raw garlic every day. It's a killer on my breath, but I haven't been sick since.","I like to get a second, third, and sometimes fourth opinion on things. My primary care doctor isn't God and I don't entrust my health to her. Her services are valuable, however."
There is nothing that prevents me from understanding basic health information. I have enough experience with the medical system that I can understand the common terms used in writing and expressed by my doctor.,Not knowing the severity of my condition and the thought of being given drugs that will have terrible side effects.,The first time I went to a doctor's visit alone. I had been enough times that I did not need any help asking questions or filling forms. ,"I have a friend who highly distrusts most doctors due to her extensive experience with them, and I trust her judgements about things. However, I have seen nothing strange from my own doctor. "
"I am able to read information and pamphlets give to me by my doctor and or pharmacy.  If I have questions, my doctor or pharmacist can explain it to me so I have a full understanding.","Well, you just never know what the results may be. So far I have been blessed with good health. But I believe any thing can happen to you at any time. But sometime I feel worried because of my age.",Was taking certain medications and I had an allergic to something I soon realized that I need to either get medical care or take something to help myself.,"My doctor and my health care plan have a very good reputation.

I had to learn how to take my medication, about surgery, recovery, rehab, physical therapy, etc.","I have never had an experience with my current primary care physician that would make me question my trust in them.  They have always been helpful, receptive and caring."
I really like taking surging like this so much. sometimes I have to ask for help because I don't be understanding. I really be having to have someone to come with me.,I really don't know I just feel worried.i just wish I had god to come and tell me what to do.i really need Jesus more on my life,I really don't know what to do nowadays.i need help like God please come and help me.i just need some help god,I really trust my doctor. he really understands me like he really caring.i just wish there was more doctors like him.
I think that I understand and am capable of understanding most of what a doctor or nurse is explaining and if I don't I can ask them to go a little more detail. I feel comfortable asking about things that I'm not quite certain about without feeling dumb.,I never know if something is wrong that I don't know about or if the doctor will find something that I didn't know was wrong. ,"I went through many years of doctor's trying to figure out a mysterious illness that I had. After some time, I decided to start doing some research on my own. I was able to come up with something that I thought fit my symptoms very well and was able to find a few doctors who agreed with me and gave me an official diagnosis. ","I think that I trust my doctor but always try to relay on my own instincts also. If there is something that I don't agree with or a treatment that I'm not sure about, I always wait and do my own research before jumping on board. "
I believe about 90%. I have worked in a medical field for quite some time so I feel a bit more prepared than many. However it always seems more daunting when you're on the other side.,It's uncomfortable to be that vulnerable.,I work at a hospital.,I haven't had a lot of experience with my new doctor that would allow me to build a proper relationship.
I feel as if I generally do understand everything that Is being said to me. At times though some things do get confusing and having anxiety I am sometimes scared to ask questions if I don't always understand what is being said. I feel I am very capable to make decisions without any help though. ,"Not knowing what the outcome is going to be is what makes me the most nervous. They sit their and run their tests, sometimes not talking very much, so you can only sit there and think that something is seriously wrong with you. I always fear for the worst, every single time. Be a use in most cases people usually get the worst news of their lives, from their doctors.","When my brother wrecked his motorcycle really bad and hit head, I knew for a fact to take him to the hospital because he was pretty much guaranteed to have a concussion. I was right. I also knew not to let him go to sleep on the way to the hospital, because going to sleep with a concussion is extremely dangerous and can actually kill someone. ","I trust my doctor because I do believe he wants to do what's best for me and really help me. I think that they always wanna do the best thing they can for their patients. They are their to help, and that's what they really try to do, in my opinion. "
I have a high degree of confidence because I stay involved in my own conditions and treatments. I am not afraid and I do ask questions until I am satisfied.,Finding out I have a condition I'm not aware of or having to go thru a test I haven't seen or heard of before.,"I'm not sure if I understand this question, but I regularly speak wtih a doctor about mental health. I have a strong understanding about the side effects of many drugs.","I had a primary physician I completely trusted. He always initiated thoughts that I had before I could state them, he spoke to me as a person and did what he could to maximize what insurance allowed, and did more. Current physician is nothing compared to him."
"I feel I have the capacity to understand health information. If I receive a diagnosis or prognosis that I can't understand or if a medical professiol uses too much jargon too quickly, I often repeat back to the professiol what I understand and allow them to clarify or correct me if I'm not understanding them. ","I often worry that results from an exam or test will point to a disease or condition such as cancer. When I wait to hear back via email from a doctor regarding test results, it is often a tense and worrisome time. ","My father had prostate cancer and I had a case of prostatitis around the age of 40. I requested a PSA test at age 42. My doctor said that this was young but because of my family history and my own trouble with my prostate, he said that the PSA test was acceptable in my case. I understood about the high rate of false positives in this case, so I knew that if I had a high PSA it didn't necessarily mean I had cancer. ","I have had hard to diagnosis conditions in the past and because I go to a large HMO where the doctors have a huge client load, I feel that there is no way that a doctor can adequately diagnosis this type of condition. After a doctor's appointment, I often combine research that I've done online with what they say or prescribe. "
I pay much to what is being told to me and if I have questions I ask them. If I don't understand something I let them know that too.,Not being able to afford the cost of the visit. I worry about being harassed about payment in the future.,Having severe allergies and nose bleeds along with  having chest pains and headaches more than once a week.,I do not see a doctor often. I only visit a doctor when I am sick. I can't afford to see a doctor on a regular basis
"just listen and ask question if need help.but,i dont need help most of the time.it is not to bad to understand.",i have trust in my doctor so i dont have to worry plus i pray and know i am in God hands.

I have an IQ somewhere north of 130 and understand multiple languages.  My body is highly damaged but my ability to process information is intact.  I generally have a better understanding of what the doctor is reading than he does.... ,"I'm about to find out that there STILL isn't a damned thing they can do for me. My weight is fairly stable, but that's about the only thing that is.  My diseases are progressive, and they absolutely refuse to allow me to use the only thing that ever helped.  ","I have multiple sclerosis.  I don't get a choice but to learn a lot about health issues.  My form is progressive rather than remitting and relapsing, and in addition I have two other disabilities.  I've learned to read medical journals and occasionally know more about neurological drugs and their side effects than some medical professionals in related fields.  This is a common occurrence.","I don't think doctors know what they think they know. I have multiple disabilities, and at least one is an orphan - no known good treatments.  The ones for the standard form don't work well if at all.  And the ones they won't give me are the only things that ever did any good!"
"I read and understand very well and I had years of experience with medical professionals because my late husband had a chronic condition.  I read all materials given to me, make notes on what I don't understand and ask the doctors about what I don't understand.  I insist that medical professionals speak to me in layman terms.  I read all the insurance documents and understand them very well.  I am the person people come to explain their benefits, charges, and how to appeal a decision.",I feel just a tiny bit worried when I haven't lost any weight or gained weight.  My doctor gives me a lecture about how important it is to exercise and maintain a healthy weight.  I trust him and hate to disappoint him.,"When my husband was dying, his gout flared up and I was able to explain to the nurse what was happening to him.  They were concerned with his heart, lungs, and kidneys and overlooked gout.  I had to explain that it was unrelated to any of those things.  Of course they knew what gout was but that didn't immediately come to mind when he was in excruciating pain.","My doctor talks to me more than he examines me and looks at test results.  He explains absolutely everything; even with pictures when I don't understand.  He insists that any problems I experience are related to my lifestyle.  He keeps  me on a low fat diet, limited alcohol, and a regular sleep schedule.  The only medication he gives me is for my eczema and sleeping pills that I should only take occasionally.  I'm instructed to return to him if I need to take the sleeping pills more than occasionally.  He gave me a nighttime routine that should help me get to sleep.  Long conversations and reviewing my blood pressure history, he discovered that my blood pressure is up only when I don't get enough sleep; so rather than blood pressure medication he wants me to get enough sleep.  "
"I think that I can get the information okay. When I don't understand something and no one else is around, I look it up online. Sometimes I ask the doctor or nurse and they can tell me the answer to my question. Sometimes I feel too embarrassed to ask because I don't want to look stupid. I think I make pretty appropriate health decisions, though.","I don't know, I don't like to get ked or just put on that paper gown. It makes me feel uncomfortable. Also, I get worried about how much it's going to cost, because even though I have insurance, the copay can still be really high.","I don't know, I haven't had to read that many things about medicine. Last semester, I had to write a 12+ page paper on the EpiPen and the price hikes and all of that. I know that it only costs a few dollars to create the pen with the epinephrine inside, but they sell for hundreds of dollars now. I don't know, I'm a little distrustful about the pharmaceutical industry, but I don't know how distrustful I am about doctors.","I don't know, I haven't been to a regular doctor for four years. I went to the gynecologist like two years ago, and that went pretty well. I've known that doctor since I was a little kid (~3-4 years old), so I do tend to trust her. I think that most doctors are probably pretty trustworthy, because they really have to work hard to become doctors in the first place, so they probably wouldn't be bad people after all of that hard work."
I feel that I am quite literate enough to understand and process basic health info.  I am healthy and physically fit.  I have a science background so I do understand scientific jargon.,I feel anxious if I am having a health issue and worried it could turn out to be something serious.

It helps me make any choices I need to make as far as health concerns go.","I don't want to be given things I am allergic to, and I want to feel better. Doctors don't always give me that feeling that I will feel better.","I always tell people the difference in storebrands and the name brands (just fillers), and I also generally inform people not to take tylenol while drinking unless they want liver failure.","Well in general, doctors sometimes listen to you and sometimes have their own agenda. I had a doctor once that knew I was allergic to codeine, so kept giving me 'alternatives' that I was also allergic to, even if I told him, yes, it says if you are allergic to codeine to not take this other one.

"I believe I have the capacity to understand some of the basics about health care.  The doctors and nurses do not take enough time, though to fully answer questions.  I feel like I'm on an assembly line when I go to the docs\ter.",My biggest fear is that of being told that I have an incurable disease or only have a few months to live.  I think my fear is that my mother died when I was young and my father was very sick as I was growing up.,We were hiking in the backwoods and my friend slipped and cut her hand.  She needed stitches and we were to far out to get help in  time.  I used my sewing kit to sew up her wound.,I never completely trust anyone.  I think that all doctors are purely in it for the money first and patient well being a distant second.  
"I feel i have a high capacity to understand and process information that's been given to me. I feel this way because i consider myself intelligent.  In addition , or maybe it goes hand and hand, i do my research on any topic i have questions on. I will never blindly take the advice or recommendations of Doctors/Nurses without also doing my own due diligence. ","The only thing that i usually dislike is getting my blood pressure taken. Not only have the PA's taken incorrect readings on many occasions, but , because i had hypertension in the past (since resolved) i still fear getting a high reading. Usually my heart rate elevates a bit while i'm getting it done. ","After i was diagnosed with Type II diabetes (three years ago) i got little to no help from my Dr. So, i took to the net and learned everything i could about it. One thing i learned is that i can deduct the fiber count from the carb count and that will be my total net carb intake.   When i was at my Dr's office and mentioned this, she did not seem to know about it or was surprised that i knew about. ","It isn't so much that i distrust my Dr. the individual, but rather i distrust the system. The system seems to have been bogged down and become nothing but a business. I was diagnosed with diabetes and a couple of other conditions three years ago and my Dr's wasn't willing to discuss much with me other than wanting to throw pills at me. I refused the pills and wanted to talk about diet, exercise, carb intake, etc.  The Dr. said she couldn't discuss this and referred me to a nutritionist that wanted $1200 up front. A Dr. should know (and probably does) the very basic starting points for diabetes care.  So, this is one big reason why i don't trust the system too much. It seems there is no persol or individual care given; just a Dr. reading from a playsheet on which pill to give for which condition. She spent zero time educating me about diabetes other than a useless pamphlet. Everything i learned i did on my own. So, in summary, i don't have too much faith in the medical profession at times because they seem more geared towards business, profit and blanket treatments then taking the individual case and doing what's best for THEM. "
"I'm quite able to ask questions that I might have about my medical needs and understand what is explained.  If there is any other questions that I have, I don't hesitate to ask.

I called my doctor and described my symptoms. They asked me about the location, appearance, and other details, and I chose to make an appointment rather than go to a hospital.","I don't see the doctor frequently enough for them to know me or my health, so it'd be difficult for them to be particularly insightful. They are usually behind and seem very rushed. They don't really examine me or ask questions. They'll look at the part pertinent to the complaint that prompted the visit and prescribe the treatment I would have guessed I needed before I went in."

If a doctor does not meet my needs I look for someone who is a better fit.
"I have full capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions as long as the doctor answers all my questions that I ask once given an answer.","The thing that causes me to feel most anxious or worried when visiting the doctor is not knowing what is wrong before I arrive and the price of a new medication she my prescribe. Medicines prices are so high that sometimes I can not afford to get them, so I have to ask my doctor to prescribe a lower price one so I can get it.","My brother in law was told his liver was not functioning properly, kidneys were bear functioning, he had 2.7 pints of blood in his body, and blood pressure was low.

"I feel pretty educated on my health conditions and feel confident in my doctors.  However, there are times when I still don't feel I have all the information I need to make health decisions.  Often, doctors are unable to ""dumb down"" language to the point where a lay person could understand.  Additionally, I feel that my time with doctors is limited.  I rarely feel that I have had as much time as I wanted.  Insurance forms are also very difficult to understand.  I almost feel like I need to have a lawyer look over everything!

After reviewing the prescription, I got it filled.  The pharmacy I visit has my health information on file.  After turning it in, I was called to the front and informed the medicine was in the same family as penicillin.  I had no idea what that meant.  The pharmacist explained that I was probably allergic to it.  I was so mad! I had told the doctor what I was allergic to! If the pharmacist hadnÃ¢ÂÂt warned me, I could have been in big trouble. So mad!","I feel that my primary care physician is concerned with my best interest.  However, it is difficult to totally trust them knowing the lobbying they receive from pharma companies.  I often wonder if I really need the medicine they prescribe or if they are receiving a kickback for it.  On the other hand, my PCP spends a lot of time answering my questions and explaining treatment options.  I do not feel pushed to take medicine I am uncomfortable with.

I dislike anything painful, and I get nervous when I am about to get test results.","My grandpa was diagnosed with cancer, and because of my education and the research I have done on my own, I was able to give him research-based information.
