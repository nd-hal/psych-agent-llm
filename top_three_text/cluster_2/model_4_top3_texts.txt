Generated text: ['My daughter often gets ear infections. One day, my wife and daughter were out running errands when she was crying so much that my wife found herself rushing to the pediatrician. After a long wait in the office, they finally were seen. The doctor took a quick look, asked a few questions, and very quickly prescribed an antibiotic. \nWhen they returned home, I asked my daughter how long she had been crying and she answered "a long time." Given the quick diagnosis and prescription I felt that I was dealing with a physician that had fallen into practicing "drive by" medicine rather than taking the time to listen and think. As soon as I had the chance I called the office manager. I had her check the records from her exam. Sure enough, the doctor hadn\'t made an actual examination. Instead, he had relied on the statement of a crying toddler and had jumped to a conclusion without proper evaluation. \n\nThat same day, the record was amended to show that an examination had occurred, and the antibiotic was never filled.']

I told him I already did, and that my knees had also been hurting a lot ever since I started exercising more.

She insisted that she wanted me to drive her to the hospital, even though the hospital was at least 45 minutes away- she didn't want to as for help from any other friends who could have. While driving, I asked her about the injury symptoms. I knew that we were most likely going to an orthopedic, but there are two types of orthopedic- one specializes is post-trauma or tendon/ligament injury; one is for congenital forming or deformity. This discussion revealed that my friend had broken her foot before, and the old break had healed incorrectly. So, once arrived at the orthopedic unit, I suggested that we ask specifically to see the doctor who specialized in post-trauma injuries, she agreed, and he admitted that my diagnosis was correct and was happy to see her."]

I can ask another physician or nurse for a second opinion to make sure that I was told correctly.I trust my primary physician because he listens to me when I tell him something and he gives me different options to choose from for my treatment. If I have a problem with the treatment I can always notify him and he will recommend something other treatment.I am always afraid that there will be more medical problems happening that I didn't know about and will have to take even more medications.

- I feel that I am very capable of processing the information and making informed decisions.  However, I find that I often forget to ask pertinent questions that I later think of at home.  I may also do some more research at home and find that I have more questions.  There have also been times where my doctor was unable to provide me with a satisfactory answer to my questions.I've worked in healthcare (previously) for over 15 years, and have had first-hand experience with many doctors.  I've seen a side of doctors that patients don't see, and some of these interactions have fostered a lack of trust.  I've had experiences where I've gone to see a new doctor and they've had a prescription written for me before I even spoke to them.  I've seen my husband prescribed contraindicated medications that caused an adverse reaction that even I knew shouldn't be taken together.  But, alternatively, I've had some doctors who treated me well who I've really trusted.  I've known other doctors to go out of their way to cater to their patient's needs/fears/wishes.My biggest fear is that I will receive news contrary to what I'm hoping for.  This doesn't have to be life-threatening, it could be as simple as finding out that a treatment must go on loner than anticipated.  Second to that is anxiety about not remembering to ask the right things or explain myself and my symptoms or condition fully, and then being misdiagnosed or wasting my time and money.My grandfather went to the urologist and had a PSA blood test done.  I knew from his results, being over 3.0, that this meant he would likely need a biopsy to test for prostate cancer.  I also knew that these tests could produce higher than normal levels if the patient has an enlarged prostate.  I asked to see his former results.  They were up and down a lot, which is typically a sign that there is NOT prostate cancer, but instead, an enlarged prostate.  I also knew that an enlarged prostate could be due to prostatitis, an infection of the prostate.  Sure enough, he went back to the doctor to follow up, and turned out to have a prostate infection.

- I don't feel that I'm directly qualified. But I ask my doctor lots of questions and make sure that I understand correctly.When I had Kaiser, I didn't trust them at all. They prescribed Codine for every little thing that I had. Now I have a private doctor through PPO and they are spot on, I'm always feeling better, I never feel like I get the run around. This difference can make my answers fill mixed. But if you were to ask me how I felt between HMO and PPO health care, it would be a landslide of an opinion.Nothing really. My current doctor takes care of me very well.My doctor prescribed me coedine. I told her about my past with coedine and Kaiser hospital. She then understood and prescribed me a different medicine.

- I am fully capable of understanding and processing basic and even advanced health information but sometimes I may need things to be explained fully to understand certain points.Doctors don't really seem to take their time with the patients, that's usually the nurses job, so they don;t seem to care too much or the cherry-picked the patients they went to care about..and I generally don't just anyone that pushes unnecessary medications and treatment on their patients so they can line their pockets or an money for their hospital. I'm not worried just cautious and aware..educated... I just do a lot of research. I read a lot of books on medicine, illnesses and the medical profession and ethics. I watch a lot of documentaries on the topic also and my mother was a nurse.   (Similarity: 0.7922)
