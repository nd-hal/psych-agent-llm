I can ask another physician or nurse for a second opinion to make sure that I was told correctly.I trust my primary physician because he listens to me when I tell him something and he gives me different options to choose from for my treatment. If I have a problem with the treatment I can always notify him and he will recommend something other treatment.I am always afraid that there will be more medical problems happening that I didn't know about and will have to take even more medications. I am also afraid that treatments will become too expensive for me to pay.I was told that I had diabetes with high blood pressure. I knew I had to get some weight off and take my medication as directed. I also had to learn how to keep my stress level down. I also needed to exercise more. (Similarity: 0.6407)
