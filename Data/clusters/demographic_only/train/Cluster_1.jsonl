I was concerned because in the past my children have had atypical symptoms for strep throat (pain, nausea but no fever). However, I knew that a cough wasn't typical either.  I watched my son's throat for a few days and there weren't any unusual signs until last Thursday night when white spots started showing up.  At that point, my usual wait and see on a fever and cough symptoms turned into a doctor's appointment.  I've learned to wait out viruses but not to mess with what could be a possible strep.  Thankfully it wasn't strep but I knew what to look for and be concerned from past experience.  "}]}
